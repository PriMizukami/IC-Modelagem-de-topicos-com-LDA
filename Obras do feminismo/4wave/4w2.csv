"Introduction"
"This is a modified version of a talk I delivered in December 2012 at TEDxEuston, a yearly conference"
"focused on Africa. Speakers from diverse fields deliver concise talks aimed at challenging and inspiring"
"Africans and friends of Africa. I had spoken at a different TED conference a few years before, giving a"
"talk titled ‘The Danger of the Single Story’ about how stereotypes limit and shape our thinking, especially"
"about Africa. It seems to me that the word feminist, and the idea of feminism itself, is also limited by"
"stereotypes. When my brother Chuks and best friend Ike, both co-organizers of the TEDxEuston"
"conference, insisted that I speak, I could not say no. I decided to speak about feminism because it is"
"something I feel strongly about. I suspected that it might not be a very popular subject, but I hoped to start"
"a necessary conversation. And so that evening as I stood onstage, I felt as though I was in the presence of"
"family – a kind and attentive audience, but one that might resist the subject of my talk. At the end, their"
"standing ovation gave me hope."

"We Should All Be Feminists"
"Okoloma was one of my greatest childhood friends. He lived on my street and looked after me like a big"
"brother: if I liked a boy, I would ask Okoloma’s opinion. Okoloma was funny and intelligent and wore"
"cowboy boots that were pointy at the tips. In December 2005, in a plane crash in southern Nigeria,"
"Okoloma died. It is still hard for me to put into words how I felt. Okoloma was a person I could argue"
"with, laugh with and truly talk to. He was also the first person to call me a feminist."
"I was about fourteen. We were in his house, arguing, both of us bristling with half-baked knowledge"
"from the books we had read. I don’t remember what this particular argument was about. But I remember"
"that as I argued and argued, Okoloma looked at me and said, ‘You know, you’re a feminist.’"
"It was not a compliment. I could tell from his tone – the same tone with which a person would say,"
"‘You’re a supporter of terrorism.’"
"I did not know exactly what this word feminist meant. And I did not want Okoloma to know that I"
"didn’t know. So I brushed it aside and continued to argue. The first thing I planned to do when I got home"
"was look up the word in the dictionary."
""
"Now fast-forward to some years later."
"In 2003, I wrote a novel called Purple Hibiscus, about a man who, among other things, beats his wife,"
"and whose story doesn’t end too well. While I was promoting the novel in Nigeria, a journalist, a nice,"
"well-meaning man, told me he wanted to advise me. (Nigerians, as you might know, are very quick to give"
"unsolicited advice.)"
"He told me that people were saying my novel was feminist, and his advice to me – he was shaking his"
"head sadly as he spoke – was that I should never call myself a feminist, since feminists are women who"
"are unhappy because they cannot find husbands."
"So I decided to call myself a Happy Feminist."
"Then an academic, a Nigerian woman, told me that feminism was not our culture, that feminism was unAfrican, and I was only calling myself a feminist because I had been influenced by Western books. (Which"
"amused me, because much of my early reading was decidedly unfeminist: I must have read every single"
""
"Mills & Boon romance published before I was sixteen. And each time I try to read those books called"
"‘classic feminist texts’, I get bored, and I struggle to finish them.)"
"Anyway, since feminism was un-African, I decided I would now call myself a Happy African Feminist."
"Then a dear friend told me that calling myself a feminist meant that I hated men. So I decided I would now"
"be a Happy African Feminist Who Does Not Hate Men. At some point I was a Happy African Feminist"
"Who Does Not Hate Men And Who Likes To Wear Lip Gloss And High Heels For Herself And Not For"
"Men."
"Of course much of this was tongue-in-cheek, but what it shows is how that word feminist is so heavy"
"with baggage, negative baggage: you hate men, you hate bras, you hate African culture, you think women"
"should always be in charge, you don’t wear make-up, you don’t shave, you’re always angry, you don’t"
"have a sense of humour, you don’t use deodorant."
""
"Now here’s a story from my childhood."
"When I was in primary school in Nsukka, a university town in south-eastern Nigeria, my teacher said at"
"the beginning of term that she would give the class a test and whoever got the highest score would be the"
"class monitor. Class monitor was a big deal. If you were class monitor, you would write down the names"
"of noise-makers each day, which was heady enough power on its own, but my teacher would also give"
"you a cane to hold in your hand while you walked around and patrolled the class for noise-makers. Of"
"course, you were not allowed to actually use the cane. But it was an exciting prospect for the nine-yearold me. I very much wanted to be class monitor. And I got the highest score on the test."
"Then, to my surprise, my teacher said the monitor had to be a boy. She had forgotten to make that clear"
"earlier; she assumed it was obvious. A boy had the second-highest score on the test. And he would be"
"monitor."
"What was even more interesting is that this boy was a sweet, gentle soul who had no interest in"
"patrolling the class with a stick. While I was full of ambition to do so."
"But I was female and he was male and he became class monitor."
"I have never forgotten that incident."
"If we do something over and over again, it becomes normal. If we see the same thing over and over"
"again, it becomes normal. If only boys are made class monitor, then at some point we will all think, even"
"if unconsciously, that the class monitor has to be a boy. If we keep seeing only men as heads of"
"corporations, it starts to seem ‘natural’ that only men should be heads of corporations."
""
"I often make the mistake of thinking that something that is obvious to me is just as obvious to everyone"
"else. Take my dear friend Louis, who is a brilliant, progressive man. We would have conversations and"
"he would tell me, ‘I don’t see what you mean by things being different and harder for women. Maybe it"
"was so in the past, but not now. Everything is fine now for women.’ I didn’t understand how Louis could"
"not see what seemed so evident."
"I love being back home in Nigeria, and spend much of my time there in Lagos, the largest city and"
"commercial hub of the country. Sometimes, in the evenings when the heat goes down and the city has a"
"slower pace, I go out with friends and family to restaurants or cafés. On one of those evenings, Louis and"
"I were out with friends."
"There is a wonderful fixture in Lagos: a sprinkling of energetic young men who hang around outside"
"certain establishments and very dramatically ‘help’ you park your car. Lagos is a metropolis of almost"
"twenty million people, with more energy than London, more entrepreneurial spirit than New York, and so"
"people come up with all sorts of ways to make a living. As in most big cities, finding parking in the"
"evenings can be difficult, so these young men make a business out of finding spots and – even when there"
"are spots available – of guiding you into yours with much gesticulating, and promising to ‘look after’ your"
"car until you get back. I was impressed with the particular theatrics of the man who found us a parking"
"spot that evening. And so as we were leaving, I decided to give him a tip. I opened my bag, put my hand"
"inside my bag to get my money, and I gave it to the man. And he, this man who was happy and grateful,"
"took the money from me, and then looked across at Louis and said, ‘Thank you, sah!’"
"Louis looked at me, surprised, and asked, ‘Why is he thanking me? I didn’t give him the money.’ Then I"
"saw realization dawn on Louis’s face. The man believed that whatever money I had ultimately came from"
"Louis. Because Louis is a man."

"Men and women are different. We have different hormones and different sexual organs and different"
"biological abilities – women can have babies, men cannot. Men have more testosterone and are, in"
"general, physically stronger than women. There are slightly more women than men in the world – 52 per"
"cent of the world’s population is female​ but most of the positions of power and prestige are occupied by"
"men. The late Kenyan Nobel peace laureate Wangari Maathai put it simply and well when she said, ‘The"
""
"higher you go, the fewer women there are.’"
"In the recent US elections, we kept hearing of the Lilly Ledbetter law, and if we go beyond that nicely"
"alliterative name, it was really about this: in the US, a man and a woman are doing the same job, with the"
"same qualifications, and the man is paid more because he is a man."
"So in a literal way, men rule the world. This made sense – a thousand years ago. Because human beings"
"lived then in a world in which physical strength was the most important attribute for survival; the"
"physically stronger person was more likely to lead. And men in general are physically stronger. (There"
"are of course many exceptions.) Today, we live in a vastly different world. The person more qualified to"
"lead is not the physically stronger person. It is the more intelligent, the more knowledgeable, the more"
"creative, more innovative. And there are no hormones for those attributes. A man is as likely as a woman"
"to be intelligent, innovative, creative. We have evolved. But our ideas of gender have not evolved very"
"much."
""
"Not long ago, I walked into the lobby of one of the best Nigerian hotels, and a guard at the entrance"
"stopped me and asked me annoying questions – What was the name and room number of the person I was"
"visiting? Did I know this person? Could I prove that I was a hotel guest by showing him my key card? –"
"because the automatic assumption is that a Nigerian female walking into a hotel alone is a sex worker."
"Because a Nigerian female alone cannot possibly be a guest paying for her own room. A man who walks"
"into the same hotel is not harassed. The assumption is that he is there for something legitimate. (Why, by"
"the way, do those hotels not focus on the demand for sex workers instead of on the ostensible supply?)"
"In Lagos, I cannot go alone into many reputable clubs and bars. They just don’t let you in if you are a"
"woman alone. You must be accompanied by a man. And so I have male friends who arrive at clubs and"
"end up going in with their arms linked with those of a complete stranger, because that complete stranger, a"
"woman out on her own, had no choice but to ask for ‘help’ to get into the club."
"Each time I walk into a Nigerian restaurant with a man, the waiter greets the man and ignores me. The"
"waiters are products of a society that has taught them that men are more important than women, and I know"
"that they don’t intend harm, but it is one thing to know something intellectually and quite another to feel it"
"emotionally. Each time they ignore me, I feel invisible. I feel upset. I want to tell them that I am just as"
"human as the man, just as worthy of acknowledgement. These are little things, but sometimes it is the little"
"things that sting the most."
"Not long ago, I wrote an article about being young and female in Lagos. And an acquaintance told me"
"that it was an angry article, and I should not have made it so angry. But I was unapologetic. Of course it"
""
"was angry. Gender as it functions today is a grave injustice. I am angry. We should all be angry. Anger has"
"a long history of bringing about positive change. But I am also hopeful, because I believe deeply in the"
"ability of human beings to remake themselves for the better."
"But back to anger. I heard the caution in the acquaintance’s tone, and I knew that the comment was as"
"much about the article as it was about my character. Anger, the tone said, is particularly not good for a"
"woman. If you are a woman, you are not supposed to express anger, because it is threatening. I have a"
"friend, an American woman, who took over a managerial position from a man. Her predecessor had been"
"considered a ‘tough go-getter’; he was blunt and hard-charging and was particularly strict about the"
"signing of time sheets. She took on her new job, and imagined herself equally tough, but perhaps a little"
"kinder than him – he didn’t always realize that people had families, she said, and she did. Only weeks"
"into her new job, she disciplined an employee about a forgery on a time sheet, just as her predecessor"
"would have done. The employee then complained to top management about her style. She was aggressive"
"and difficult to work with, the employee said. Other employees agreed. One said they had expected that"
"she would bring a ‘woman’s touch’ to her job, but she hadn’t."
"It didn’t occur to any of them that she was doing the same thing for which a man had been praised."
"I have another friend, also an American woman, who has a high-paying job in advertising. She is one of"
"two women in her team. Once, at a meeting, she said she had felt slighted by her boss, who had ignored"
"her comments and then praised something similar when it came from a man. She wanted to speak up, to"
"challenge her boss. But she didn’t. Instead, after the meeting, she went to the bathroom and cried, then"
"called me to vent about it. She didn’t want to speak up because she didn’t want to seem aggressive. She"
"let her resentments simmer."
"What struck me – with her and with many other female American friends I have – is how invested they"
"are in being ‘liked’. How they have been raised to believe that their being likeable is very important and"
"that this ‘likeable’ trait is a specific thing. And that specific thing does not include showing anger or being"
"aggressive or disagreeing too loudly."
"We spend too much time teaching girls to worry about what boys think of them. But the reverse is not"
"the case. We don’t teach boys to care about being likeable. We spend too much time telling girls that they"
"cannot be angry or aggressive or tough, which is bad enough, but then we turn around and either praise or"
"excuse men for the same reasons. All over the world, there are so many magazine articles and books"
"telling women what to do, how to be and not to be, in order to attract or please men. There are far fewer"
"guides for men about pleasing women."
"I teach a writing workshop in Lagos and one of the participants, a young woman, told me that a friend"
"had told her not to listen to my ‘feminist talk’; otherwise she would absorb ideas that would destroy her"
"marriage. This is a threat – the destruction of a marriage, the possibility of not having a marriage at all –"
"that in our society is much more likely to be used against a woman than against a man."
"Gender matters everywhere in the world. And I would like today to ask that we should begin to dream"
""
"about and plan for a different world. A fairer world. A world of happier men and happier women who are"
"truer to themselves. And this is how to start: we must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise"
"our sons differently."
""
"We do a great disservice to boys in how we raise them. We stifle the humanity of boys. We define"
"masculinity in a very narrow way. Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage."
"We teach boys to be afraid of fear, of weakness, of vulnerability. We teach them to mask their true"
"selves, because they have to be, in Nigerian-speak, a hard man."
"In secondary school, a boy and a girl go out, both of them teenagers with meagre pocket money. Yet the"
"boy is expected to pay the bills, always, to prove his masculinity. (And we wonder why boys are more"
"likely to steal money from their parents.)"
"What if both boys and girls were raised not to link masculinity and money? What if their attitude was"
"not ‘the boy has to pay’, but rather, ‘whoever has more should pay’? Of course, because of their historical"
"advantage, it is mostly men who will have more today. But if we start raising children differently, then in"
"fifty years, in a hundred years, boys will no longer have the pressure of proving their masculinity by"
"material means."
"But by far the worst thing we do to males – by making them feel they have to be hard – is that we leave"
"them with very fragile egos. The harder a man feels compelled to be, the weaker his ego is."
"And then we do a much greater disservice to girls, because we raise them to cater to the fragile egos of"
"males."
"We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller."
"We say to girls, ‘You can have ambition, but not too much. You should aim to be successful but not too"
"successful, otherwise you will threaten the man. If you are the breadwinner in your relationship with a"
"man, pretend that you are not, especially in public, otherwise you will emasculate him.’"
"But what if we question the premise itself? Why should a woman’s success be a threat to a man? What"
"if we decide to simply dispose of that word – and I don’t know if there is an English word I dislike more"
"than this – emasculation."
"A Nigerian acquaintance once asked me if I was worried that men would be intimidated by me."
"I was not worried at all – it had not even occurred to me to be worried, because a man who would be"
"intimidated by me is exactly the kind of man I would have no interest in."
"Still, I was struck by this. Because I am female, I’m expected to aspire to marriage. I am expected to"
"make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important. Marriage can be a good"
""
"thing, a source of joy, love and mutual support. But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage, yet we"
"don’t teach boys to do the same?"
"I know a Nigerian woman who decided to sell her house because she didn’t want to intimidate a man"
"who might want to marry her."
"I know an unmarried woman in Nigeria who, when she goes to conferences, wears a wedding ring"
"because she wants her colleagues to – according to her – ‘give her respect’."
"The sadness in this is that a wedding ring will indeed automatically make her seem worthy of respect,"
"while not wearing a wedding ring would make her easily dismissible – and this is in a modern"
"workplace."
"I know young women who are under so much pressure – from family, from friends, even from work – to"
"get married that they are pushed to make terrible choices."
"Our society teaches a woman at a certain age who is unmarried to see it as a deep personal failure."
"While a man at a certain age who is unmarried has not quite come around to making his pick."
"It is easy to say, ‘But women can just say no to all this.’ But the reality is more difficult, more complex."
"We are all social beings. We internalize ideas from our socialization."
"Even the language we use illustrates this. The language of marriage is often a language of ownership,"
"not a language of partnership."
"We use the word respect for something a woman shows a man, but not often for something a man shows"
"a woman."
"Both men and women will say, ‘I did it for peace in my marriage.’"
"When men say it, it is usually about something they should not be doing anyway. Something they say to"
"their friends in a fondly exasperated way, something that ultimately proves to them their masculinity –"
"‘Oh, my wife said I can’t go to clubs every night, so now, for peace in my marriage, I go only on"
"weekends.’"
"When women say ‘I did it for peace in my marriage,’ it is usually because they have given up a job, a"
"career goal, a dream."
"We teach females that in relationships, compromise is what a woman is more likely to do."
"We raise girls to see each other as competitors – not for jobs or accomplishments, which in my opinion"
"can be a good thing, but for the attention of men."
"We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way boys are. If we have sons, we don’t mind"
"knowing about their girlfriends. But our daughters’ boyfriends? God forbid. (But we of course expect"
"them to bring home the perfect man for marriage when the time is right.)"
"We police girls. We praise girls for virginity but we don’t praise boys for virginity (and it makes me"
"wonder how exactly this is supposed to work out, since the loss of virginity is a process that usually"
"involves two people of opposite genders)."
"Recently a young woman was gang-raped in a university in Nigeria, and the response of many young"
""
"Nigerians, both male and female, was something like this: ‘Yes, rape is wrong, but what is a girl doing in"
"a room with four boys?’"
"Let us, if we can, forget the horrible inhumanity of that response. These Nigerians have been raised to"
"think of women as inherently guilty. And they have been raised to expect so little of men that the idea of"
"men as savage beings with no self-control is somehow acceptable."
"We teach girls shame. Close your legs. Cover yourself. We make them feel as though by being born"
"female, they are already guilty of something. And so girls grow up to be women who cannot say they have"
"desire. Who silence themselves. Who cannot say what they truly think. Who have turned pretence into an"
"art form."
"I know a woman who hates domestic work, but she pretends that she likes it, because she has been"
"taught that to be ‘good wife material’, she has to be – to use that Nigerian word – homely. And then she"
"got married. And her husband’s family began to complain that she had changed. Actually, she had not"
"changed. She just got tired of pretending to be what she was not."
"The problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are."
"Imagine how much happier we would be, how much freer to be our true individual selves, if we didn’t"
"have the weight of gender expectations."
""
"Boys and girls are undeniably different biologically, but socialization exaggerates the differences, and"
"then starts a self-fulfilling process. Take cooking, for example. Today, women in general are more likely"
"to do housework than men – cooking and cleaning. But why is that? Is it because women are born with a"
"cooking gene or because over the years they have been socialized to see cooking as their role? I was"
"going to say that perhaps women are born with a cooking gene until I remembered that the majority of"
"famous cooks in the world – who are given the fancy title of ‘chef’ – are men."
"I used to look at my grandmother, a brilliant woman, and wonder what she would have been if she’d"
"had the same opportunities as men during her youth. Today, there are more opportunities for women than"
"there were during my grandmother’s time, because of changes in policy and law, which are very"
"important."
"But what matters even more is our attitude, our mindset."
"What if, in raising children, we focus on ability instead of gender? What if we focus on interest instead"
"of gender?"
""
"I know a family who has a son and a daughter, a year apart in age, both brilliant at school. When the boy"
"is hungry, the parents say to the girl, ‘Go and cook Indomie noodles for your brother.’ The girl doesn’t like"
"to cook Indomie noodles, but she is a girl and she has to. What if the parents, from the beginning, taught"
"both children to cook them? Cooking, by the way, is a useful and practical life skill for a boy to have. I’ve"
"never thought it made much sense to leave such a crucial thing – the ability to nourish oneself – in the"
"hands of others."
"I know a woman who has the same degree and same job as her husband. When they get back from work,"
"she does most of the housework, which is true for many marriages, but what struck me was that whenever"
"he changed the baby’s nappy, she said thank you to him. What if she saw it as something normal and"
"natural, that he should help care for his child?"
""
"I am trying to unlearn many lessons of gender I internalized while growing up. But I sometimes still feel"
"vulnerable in the face of gender expectations."
"The first time I taught a writing class in graduate school, I was worried. Not about the teaching"
"material, because I was well prepared and I was teaching what I enjoyed. Instead I was worried about"
"what to wear. I wanted to be taken seriously."
"I knew that because I was female, I would automatically have to prove my worth. And I was worried"
"that if I looked too feminine, I would not be taken seriously. I really wanted to wear my shiny lip gloss"
"and my girly skirt, but I decided not to. I wore a very serious, very manly and very ugly suit."
"The sad truth of the matter is that when it comes to appearance, we start off with men as the standard, as"
"the norm. Many of us think that the less feminine a woman appears, the more likely she is to be taken"
"seriously. A man going to a business meeting doesn’t wonder about being taken seriously based on what"
"he is wearing – but a woman does."
"I wish I had not worn that ugly suit that day. Had I then the confidence I have now to be myself, my"
"students would have benefited even more from my teaching. Because I would have been more comfortable"
"and more fully and truly myself."
"I have chosen to no longer be apologetic for my femininity. And I want to be respected in all my"
"femaleness. Because I deserve to be. I like politics and history and am happiest when having a good"

"argument about ideas. I am girly. I am happily girly. I like high heels and trying on lipsticks. It’s nice to be"
"complimented by both men and women (although I have to be honest and say that I prefer the compliments"
"of stylish women), but I often wear clothes that men don’t like or don’t ‘understand’. I wear them because"
"I like them and because I feel good in them. The ‘male gaze’, as a shaper of my life’s choices, is largely"
"incidental."
""
"Gender is not an easy conversation to have. It makes people uncomfortable, sometimes even irritable."
"Both men and women are resistant to talk about gender, or are quick to dismiss the problems of gender."
"Because thinking of changing the status quo is always uncomfortable."
"Some people ask, ‘Why the word feminist? Why not just say you are a believer in human rights, or"
"something like that?’ Because that would be dishonest. Feminism is, of course, part of human rights in"
"general – but to choose to use the vague expression human rights is to deny the specific and particular"
"problem of gender. It would be a way of pretending that it was not women who have, for centuries, been"
"excluded. It would be a way of denying that the problem of gender targets women. That the problem was"
"not about being human, but specifically about being a female human. For centuries, the world divided"
"human beings into two groups and then proceeded to exclude and oppress one group. It is only fair that the"
"solution to the problem should acknowledge that."
"Some men feel threatened by the idea of feminism. This comes, I think, from the insecurity triggered by"
"how boys are brought up, how their sense of self-worth is diminished if they are not ‘naturally’ in charge"
"as men."
""
"Other men might respond by saying, ‘Okay, this is interesting, but I don’t think like that. I don’t even think"
"about gender.’"
"Maybe not."
"And that is part of the problem. That many men do not actively think about gender or notice gender."
"That many men say, like my friend Louis did, that things might have been bad in the past but everything is"
"fine now. And that many men do nothing to change it. If you are a man and you walk into a restaurant and"
"the waiter greets just you, does it occur to you to ask the waiter, ‘Why have you not greeted her?’ Men"
"need to speak out in all of these ostensibly small situations."
""
"Because gender can be uncomfortable, there are easy ways to close this conversation."
"Some people will bring up evolutionary biology and apes, how female apes bow to male apes – that"
"sort of thing. But the point is this: we are not apes. Apes also live in trees and eat earthworms. We do not."
"Some people will say, ‘Well, poor men also have a hard time.’ And they do."
"But that is not what this conversation is about. Gender and class are different. Poor men still have the"
"privileges of being men, even if they do not have the privileges of being wealthy. I learned a lot about"
"systems of oppression and how they can be blind to one another by talking to black men. I was once"
"talking about gender and a man said to me, ‘Why does it have to be you as a woman? Why not you as a"
"human being?’ This type of question is a way of silencing a person’s specific experiences. Of course I am"
"a human being, but there are particular things that happen to me in the world because I am a woman. This"
"same man, by the way, would often talk about his experience as a black man. (To which I should probably"
"have responded, ‘Why not your experiences as a man or as a human being? Why a black man?’)"
"So, no, this conversation is about gender. Some people will say, ‘Oh, but women have the real power:"
"bottom power.’ (This is a Nigerian expression for a woman who uses her sexuality to get things from"
"men.) But bottom power is not power at all, because the woman with bottom power is actually not"
"powerful; she just has a good route to tap another person’s power. And then what happens if the man is in"
"a bad mood or sick or temporarily impotent?"
"Some people will say a woman is subordinate to men because it’s our culture. But culture is constantly"

"privileges men, and only the male members of the extended family can attend the meetings where major"
"family decisions are taken. So although I am the one who is most interested in these things, I cannot attend"
"the meeting. I cannot have a formal say. Because I am female."
"Culture does not make people. People make culture. If it is true that the full humanity of women is not"
"our culture, then we can and must make it our culture."

"My great-grandmother, from stories I’ve heard, was a feminist. She ran away from the house of the man"

"ABOUT THE AUTHOR"
"Caitlin Moran had literally no friends in 1990, and so had plenty of"
"time to write her first novel, The Chronicles of Narmo, at the age of"
"fifteen. At sixteen she joined music weekly Melody Maker, and at"
"eighteen briefly presented the pop show ‘Naked City’ on Channel 4."
"Following this precocious start she then put in eighteen solid years"
"as a columnist on The Times – both as a TV critic and also in the"
"most-read part of the paper, the satirical celebrity column ‘Celebrity"
"Watch’ – winning the British Press Awards’ Columnist of The Year"
"award in 2010."
"The eldest of eight children, home-educated in a council"
"house in Wolverhampton, Caitlin read lots of books about feminism"
"– mainly in an attempt to be able to prove to her brother, Eddie, that"
"she was scientifically better than him."
"Caitlin isn’t really her name. She was christened ‘Catherine’."
"But she saw ‘Caitlin’ in a Jilly Cooper novel when she was 13 and"
"thought it looked exciting. That’s why she pronounces it incorrectly:"
"‘Catlin’. It causes trouble for everyone."

"PROLOGUE"
""
"The Worst Birthday Ever"
"WOLVERHAMPTON, 5 APRIL 1988"
"Here I am, on my 13th birthday. I am running. I’m running from The"
"Yobs."
"‘Boy!’"
"‘Gyppo!’"
"‘Boy!’"
"I’m running from The Yobs in the playground by our house. It"
"is a typical playground of Britain in the late eighties. There’s no such"
"thing as safety surfaces, ergonomic design or, indeed, slats on the"
"benches. Everything’s made of concrete, broken Corona pop bottles"
"and weeds."
"As I run, I’m totally alone. I can feel the breath in my throat"
"catching, like sick. I’ve seen nature documentaries like this before. I"
"can see what’s happening here. My role is, clearly, that of ‘weak"
"antelope, separated from the pack’. The Yobs are ‘the lions’. I know"
"this never really ends well for the antelope. Soon, my role will turn"
"into a new one: that of ‘lunch’."
"‘Yah pikey!’"
"I’m wearing Wellington boots, NHS glasses that make me"
"look like Alan Bennett, and my dad’s Withnail-style army coat. I do"
"not, I admit, look very feminine. Diana, Princess of Wales is"
"feminine. Kylie Minogue is feminine. I am … femi-none. So I"
"understand The Yobs’ confusion. They do not look as if they have"
"dabbled much in either a) the iconography of the counter-culture or"
"b) the inspirational imagery of radical gender-benders. I imagine"
"they were confused by both Annie Lennox and Boy George when"
"they appeared on Top of the Pops."
"If they weren’t so busy chasing me, I would probably say"
"something to this effect. Maybe I would tell them that I have read The"
"Well of Loneliness, by famous, trouser-wearing lesbian Radclyffe"
"Hall, and that they need to open their minds to alternative modes of"
"dress. Perhaps I would mention Chrissie Hynde, too. She wears"
"masculine tailoring. And Caryn Franklin on The Clothes Show – and"
"she seems lovely!"
"‘Yah pikey!’"
"The Yobs stop for a moment, and appear to confer. I slow to a"
"trot, lean against a tree and hyperventilate wildly. I am knackered. At"
"13 stone, I am not really built for hot pursuit. I am less Zola Budd –"
"more Elmer Fudd. As I catch my breath, I reflect on my situation."
"It would be amazing, I think, if I had a pet dog. A well-trained"
"German Shepherd, who would attack these boys – almost brutally."
"An animal really in tune with the fear and apprehension of its owner."
"I observe my pet German Shepherd, Saffron, 200 yards away."
"She is joyfully rolling in a slick of fox shit, and waving her legs in the"
"air with joy. The dog looks so happy. Today is working out really well"
"for it. This is a much longer, and faster, walk than usual."
"Although today is obviously not working out very well for me, I"
"am none the less surprised when – having finished their tête-à-tête"
"– The Yobs pause for a minute, and then start throwing stones at"
"me. That seems a bit extreme, I think. I start running again."
""
"You don’t have to go to this bother to oppress me! I think,"
"indignantly. I was already pretty subjugated! Honestly – you had me"
"at ‘Pikey’."
"Only a few of the stones actually hit me and, obviously, they"
"don’t hurt: this coat has been through a war, possibly two. Pebbles"
"are nothing. It’s built for grenades."
"But it’s the thought that counts. All this time spent on me,"
"when they could be engaging in other, more worthwhile pursuits –"
"like abusing solvents, and fingering girls who are actually dressed"
"as girls."
"As if reading my mind, after a minute or so The Yobs begin to"
"lose interest in me. It looks like I’m yesterday’s antelope now. I’m"
"still running, but they’re just standing still – throwing the occasional"
"rock in my direction, in an almost leisurely way, until I’m out of"
"range. They don’t stop shouting, however."
"‘You bloke!’ the biggest Yob shouts, as a final thought at my"
"departing back. ‘You … bummer!’"
"I get home, and cry on the doorstep. It’s honestly too crowded to cry"
"in the house. I’ve tried crying in the house before – you explain why"
"you’re crying to one person between the sobs, and then you’re only"
"halfway through before someone else comes in, and needs to hear"
"the story from the top again, and before you know it, you’ve told the"
"worst bit six times, and wound yourself up into such an hysterical"
"state you have hiccups for the rest of the afternoon."
"When you live in a small house with five younger siblings, it’s"
"actually far more sensible – and much quicker – to cry alone."
"I look at the dog."
"If you were a good and faithful hound, you’d drink the tears off"
"my face, I think."
"Saffron noisily licks her vagina instead."
"Saffron is our new dog – ‘the stupid new dog’. She is also a"
"‘dodgy dog’ – my dad ‘procured’ her in one of the deals he"
"periodically conducts at the Hollybush pub, which involve us sitting"
"outside in the van for two hours, while he occasionally brings us"
"crisps, or a bottle of Coke. At some point, he’ll suddenly come"
"bowling out at a rapid lick, carrying something incongruous like a"
"bag of gravel or a statue of a concrete fox with no head."
"‘It’s gone a bit serious in there,’ he would say, before gunning"
"off at top speed, pissed."
"On one occasion, the incongruous thing he came out carrying"
"was Saffron – a one-year-old German Shepherd."
"‘Used to be a police dog,’ he said, proudly, putting her in the"
"back of the van with us, where she promptly shat all over everything."
"Further investigation revealed that, whilst she had been a police"
"dog, it was only a week before the police dog trainers realised she"
"was profoundly psychologically disturbed, and scared of:"
"1) loud noises"
"2) the dark"
"3) all people"
"4) all other dogs"
"5) and suffers stress incontinence."
""
"Still, she is my dog and, technically, the only friend I have who isn’t a"
"blood relation."
"‘Stay near, old friend!’ I say to her, blowing my nose on my"
"sleeve, and resolving to become cheerful again. ‘Today will be truly"
"notable!’"
"Having finished crying, I climb over the side fence and let"
"myself in through the back door. Mum is in the kitchen, ‘getting the"
"party ready’."
"‘Go into the front room!’ she says. ‘Wait in there! And DON’T"
"LOOK AT THE CAKE! It’s a surprise!’"
"The front room is packed with my siblings. They have"
"materialised from every nook and cranny in the house. In 1988,"
"there are six of us – there are eight by the time the decade is out. My"
"mother is like some Ford car production line, producing a small,"
"gobby baby every two years, as regular as clockwork, until our"
"house is full to bursting point."
"Caz – two years younger than me, ginger, nihilistic – is lying"
"across the sofa. She doesn’t move when I come in. There is"
"nowhere else for me to sit."
"‘AHEM!’ I say, pointing at the badge on my lapel. It says, ‘It’s"
"my BIRTHDAY!!!!’ I am forgetting all about crying now. I have moved"
"on."
"‘It’ll be over in six hours,’ she says, flatly, immobile. ‘Why don’t"
"we just stop the charade now?’"
"‘Only six hours of FUN left!’ I say. ‘Six hours of BIRTHDAY"
"FUN. Who KNOWS what could happen! This place is a MAD"
"HOUSE, after all!’"
"I am, by and large, boundlessly positive. I have all the joyful"
"ebullience of an idiot. My diary entry for yesterday was ‘moved the"
"deep fat fryer onto the other worktop – it looks BRILLIANT!’"
"My favourite place in the world – the south beach at"
"Aberystwyth – has a sewage outfall pipe on it."
"I truly believe the new, stupid dog is our old dog, reincarnated"
"– even though our new dog was born two years before the old dog"
"died."
"‘But you can see Sparky’s eyes in there!’ I will say, looking at"
"the stupid new dog. ‘Sparky NEVER LEFT US!’"
"Rolling her eyes in disdain, Caz gives me her card. It is a"
"picture of me, in which she has drawn my nose so that it takes up"
"approximately three-quarters of my head."
"‘Remember: you promised you’d move out on your 18th"
"birthday, so I can have your room,’ it says inside. ‘Only five years to"
"go now! Unless you die before then! Love Caz.’"
"Weena is nine – her card is also based around me moving"
"out and giving her my bedroom: although she has robots saying it,"
"which makes it less ‘personal’."
"Space really is at a premium in our house, as evidenced by"
"the fact I still have nowhere to sit. I am just about to sit on my brother"
"Eddie when Mum comes in, holding a plate of burning candles."
"‘Happy Birthday TO YOU!’ everyone sings to me. ‘I went to"
"THE ZOO. I saw a FAT MONKEY – and I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU!’"
"Mum crouches down to where I am on the floor, and holds the"
"plate out in front of me."
"‘Blow them out and make a wish!’ she says, brightly."
"‘It’s not a cake,’ I say. ‘It’s a baguette.’"
"‘Filled with Philadelphia!’ mum says, cheerfully."
""
"‘It’s a baguette,’ I repeat. ‘And there’s only seven candles.’"
"‘You’re too old for a cake any more,’ Mum says, blowing out"
"the candles herself. ‘And the candles count for two years each!’"
"‘That would be 14.’"
"‘Stop being so fussy!’"
"I eat my birthday baguette. It’s lovely. I love Philadelphia."
"Lovely Philadelphia! So cool! So creamy!"
"That night – in the bed I share with my three-year-old sister, Prinnie"
"– I write up my diary."
"‘My 13th birthday!!!!’ I write. ‘Porridge for brekkie, sausage and"
"chips for dinner, baguette for tea. Got £20 all in all. 4 cards and 2"
"letters. Get green (teenage) ticket from library tomorrow!!!!! Man next"
"door asked us if we wanted some chairs he was throwing out. We"
"said YES!!!!’"
"I stare at the entry for a minute. I should put everything in, I"
"think. I can’t leave out the bad stuff."
"‘Some boys were shouting rude thinks [sic] in the field,’ I write,"
"slowly. ‘It’s because their willies are getting big.’"
"I have read enough about puberty to know that burgeoning"
"sexual desires can often make teenage boys act cruelly towards"
"girls."
"I also know that, in this case, it really was not suppressed"
"desire that made those boys throw gravel at me while I ran up a hill"
"– but I don’t want my diary to pity me. As far as my diary will know, I"
"had the philosophical upper hand there. This diary is for glory only."
"I stare at the entry for my 13th birthday. A moment of"
"unwelcome clarity washes over me. Here I am, I think, sharing my"
"bed with a toddler, and wearing my dad’s old thermal underwear as"
"pyjamas. I am 13 years old, I am 13 stone, I have no money, no"
"friends, and boys throw gravel at me when they see me. It’s my"
"birthday, and I went to bed at 7.15pm."
"I turn to the back page of my diary. This is where I have my"
"‘long-term’ projects. For instance, ‘My Bad Points’."
"My Bad Points"
"1) I eat too much"
"2) I don’t take any exercise"
"3) Quick bursts of rage"
"4) Loseing [sic] everything"
"‘My Bad Points’ were written down on New Year’s Eve. A month"
"later, I have written my progress report:"
"1) I no longer eat gingernuts"
"2) Take dog for a walk every day"
"3) Trying"
"4) Trying"
"Underneath all these, I draw a line, and write my new list."
"By The Time I’m 18"
""
"1) Loose weight [sic]"
"2) Have good clothes"
"3) Have freinds [sic]"
"4) Train dog properly"
"5) Ears pierced?"
"Oh God. I just don’t have a clue. I don’t have a clue how I will ever be"
"a woman."
"When Simone de Beauvoir said, ‘One is not born a woman – one"
"becomes one,’ she didn’t know the half of it."
"In the 22 years that have passed since my 13th birthday, I"
"have become far more positive about being a woman – indeed to"
"be honest, it all picked up considerably when I got some fake ID, a"
"laptop and a nice blouse – but in many ways, there is no crueller or"
"more inappropriate present to give a child than oestrogen and a big"
"pair of tits. Had anyone asked me in advance of my birthday, I think I"
"would have requested a book token or maybe a voucher for C&A,"
"instead."
"At the time, I was – as you can see – far too busy fighting with"
"my siblings, training my dog and watching the classic musicals of"
"MGM to ever have made space in my schedule for becoming a"
"woman until my hand was forced, eventually, by my pituitary gland."
"Becoming a woman felt a bit like becoming famous. For, from"
"being benevolently generally ignored – the base-line existence of"
"most children – a teenage girl is suddenly fascinating to others, and"
"gets bombarded with questions: What size are you? Have you done"
"it yet? Will you have sex with me? Have you got ID? Do you want to"
"try a puff of this? Are you seeing anyone? Have you got protection?"
"What’s your signature style? Can you walk in heels? Who are your"
"heroes? Are you getting a Brazilian? What porn do you like? Do you"
"want to get married? When are you going to have kids? Are you a"
"feminist? Were you just flirting with that man? What do you want to"
"do? WHO ARE YOU?"
"All ridiculous questions to ask of a 13-year-old simply"
"because she now needs a bra. They might as well have been"
"asking my dog. I had absolutely no idea."
"But – like a soldier dropped into a war zone – you have to get"
"some ideas, and fast. You need reconnaissance. You have to plan."
"You have to single out your objectives, and then move. Because"
"once those hormones kick in, there’s no way to stop them. As I"
"rapidly discovered, you are a monkey strapped inside a rocket; an"
"element in a bomb-timer. There isn’t an exit plan. You can’t call the"
"whole thing off – however often you may wish you could. This shit is"
"going to happen, whether you like it or not."
"There are those who try to stop it, of course: the teenage girls"
"who try to buy themselves time by aggressively regressing back to"
"their five-year-old selves, and becoming obsessed with ‘girliness’,"
"and pink. Filling their beds with teddies, to make it clear there’s no"
"room for sex. Talking in baby language, so they aren’t asked adult"
"questions. At school, I could see some of my contemporaries were"
"choosing not to be active women – out there, making their own fate"
"– but to be princesses, just waiting to be ‘found’, and married,"
"instead. Although obviously I didn’t analyse it like that at the time. I"
""
"just noticed Katie Parkes spent every maths lesson drawing hearts"
"on her knuckles in Biro and showing them to David Morley – who, by"
"rights, should have been experiencing his first stirrings of sexual"
"excitement when looking at my exemplary long division instead."
"And at the most dysfunctional end, of course, there are the"
"kamikaze girls who wade into war with their pituitary – trying to"
"starve it, or confuse it into defeat, with anorexia, or bulimia."
"But the problem with battling yourself is that even if you win,"
"you lose. At some point – scarred, and exhausted – you either"
"accept that you must become a woman – that you are a woman – or"
"you die. This is the brutal, root truth of adolescence – that it is often"
"a long, painful campaign of attrition. Those self-harming girls, with"
"the latticework of razor-cuts on their arms and thighs, are just"
"reminding themselves that their body is a battlefield. If you don’t"
"have the stomach for razors, a tattoo will do; or even just the"
"lightning snap of the earring gun in Claire’s Accessories. There."
"There you are. You have dropped a marker-pin on your body, to"
"reclaim yourself, to remind you where you are: inside yourself."
"Somewhere. Somewhere in there."
"And – just as with winning the lottery, or becoming famous –"
"there is no manual for becoming a woman, even though the stakes"
"are so high. God knows, when I was 13, I tried to find one. You can"
"read about other people’s experiences on the matter – by way of"
"trying to crib, in advance, for an exam – but I found that this is, in"
"itself, problematic. For throughout history, you can read the stories"
"of women who – against all the odds – got being a woman right, but"
"ended up being compromised, unhappy, hobbled or ruined,"
"because all around them, society was still wrong. Show a girl a"
"pioneering hero – Sylvia Plath, Dorothy Parker, Frida Kahlo,"
"Cleopatra, Boudicca, Joan of Arc – and you also, more often than"
"not, show a girl a woman who was eventually crushed. Your hardwon triumphs can be wholly negated if you live in a climate where"
"your victories are seen as threatening, incorrect, distasteful or –"
"most crucially of all, for a teenage girl – simply uncool. Few girls"
"would choose to be right – right, down into their clever, brilliant"
"bones – but lonely."
"So whilst How To Be a Woman is the story of all the times that"
"I – uninformed, underprepared, fatally deluded as to my ability to"
"‘style out’ a poncho – got being a woman wrong, in the 21st century,"
"merely recounting experience doesn’t seem to be enough any"
"more. Yes, an old-fashioned feminist ‘consciousness raising’ still"
"has enormous value. When the subject turns to abortion, cosmetic"
"intervention, birth, motherhood, sex, love, work, misogyny, fear, or"
"just how you feel in your own skin, women still won’t often tell the"
"truth to each other unless they are very, very drunk. Perhaps the"
"endlessly reported rise in female binge-drinking is simply modern"
"women’s attempt to communicate with each other. Or maybe it is"
"because Sancerre is so very delicious. To be honest, I’ll take bets"
"on either."
"However, whilst chipping in your six penn’orth on what it’s"
"actually like – rather than what we pretend it’s like – to be a woman"
"is vital, we still also need a bit of analysis-y, argument-y, ‘this needs"
"to change-y’ stuff. You know. Feminism."
"And this is where the second problem arises. Feminism, you"
"would think, would cover all this. But feminism, as it stands, well …"
"stands. It has ground to a halt. Again and again over the last few"
""
"years, I turned to modern feminism to answer questions that I had"
"but found that what had once been the one most exciting, incendiary"
"and effective revolution of all time had somehow shrunk down into a"
"couple of increasingly small arguments, carried out among a"
"couple of dozen feminist academics, in books that only feminist"
"academics would read, and discussed at 11pm on BBC4. Here’s"
"my beef with this:"
"1) Feminism is too important to only be discussed by"
"academics. And, more pertinently:"
"2) I’m not a feminist academic, but, by God, feminism is"
"so serious, momentous and urgent, that now is really"
"the time for it to be championed by a lighthearted"
"broadsheet columnist and part-time TV critic, who has"
"appalling spelling. If something’s thrilling and fun, I"
"want to join in – not watch from the sidelines. I have stuff"
"to say! Camille Paglia has Lady Gaga ALL WRONG! The"
"feminist organisation Object are nuts when it comes to"
"pornography! Germaine Greer, my heroine, is crackers"
"on the subject of transgender issues! And no one is"
"tackling OK! magazine, £600 handbags, tiny pants,"
"Brazilians, stupid hen nights or Katie Price."
"And they have to be tackled. They have to be tackled, rugby-style,"
"face down in the mud, with lots of shouting."
"Traditional feminism would tell you that these are not the"
"important issues: that we should concentrate on the big stuff like"
"pay inequality, female circumcision in the Third World, and"
"domestic abuse. And they are, obviously, pressing and disgusting"
"and wrong, and the world cannot look itself squarely in the eye until"
"they’re stopped."
"But all those littler, stupider, more obvious day-to-day"
"problems with being a woman are, in many ways, just as"
"deleterious to women’s peace of mind. It is the ‘Broken Windows’"
"philosophy, transferred to female inequality. In the ‘Broken"
"Windows’ theory, if a single broken window on an empty building is"
"ignored, and not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few"
"more windows. Eventually, they may break into the building, and"
"light fires, or become squatters."
"Similarly, if we live in a climate where female pubic hair is"
"considered distasteful, or famous and powerful women are"
"constantly pilloried for being too fat or too thin, or badly dressed,"
"then, eventually, people start breaking into women, and lighting fires"
"in them. Women will get squatters. Clearly, this is not a welcome"
"state of affairs. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to wake up"

"I Start Bleeding!"
"So, I had assumed it was optional. I know that women bleed every"
"month, but I didn’t think it was going to happen to me. I’d presumed"
"I would be able to opt out of it – perhaps from sheer unwillingness."
"It honestly doesn’t look that much use or fun, and I can’t see any"
"way I can fit it into my schedule."
"I’m just not going to bother! I think to myself, cheerfully, as I do"
"my ten sit-ups a night. Captain Moran is opting out!"
"I am taking my ‘By The Time I’m 18’ list very seriously. My"
"‘Loose [sic] Weight’ campaign has stepped up a gear – not only am"
"I still not eating gingernuts, but I’m also doing ten sit-ups and ten"
"press-ups a night. We don’t have any full-length mirrors in the"
"house, so I’ve no idea how I’m doing, but I imagine that, at this rate,"
"my boot-camp regime will have me as slender as Winona Ryder by"
"Christmas."
"I’d only found out about periods four months ago, anyway. My"
"mother never told us about them – ‘I thought you’d picked it all up"
"from Moonlighting,’ she said, vaguely, when, years later, I asked her"
"about it – and it’s only when I came across a Lil-lets leaflet, stuffed"
"in the hedge outside our house by a passing schoolgirl, that I’d"
"discovered what the whole menstrual deal was."
"‘I don’t want to talk about this,’ Caz says, when I come into the"
"bedroom with the leaflet, and try to show it to her."
"‘But have you seen?’ I ask her, sitting on the end of her bed."
"She moves to the other end of the bed. Caz doesn’t like ‘nearness’."
"It makes her extremely irascible. In a three-bedroom council house"
"with seven people in it, she is almost perpetually furious."
"‘Look – this is the womb, and this is the vagina, and the Lil-let"
"expands widthways, to fill the … burrow,’ I say."
"I’ve only skim-read the leaflet. To be honest, it has blown my"
"mind quite badly. The cross-section of the female reproductive"
"system looks complicated, and impractical – like one of those very"
"expensive Rotastak hamster cages, with tunnels going everywhere."
"Again, I’m not really sure I want ‘in’ on all of this. I think I thought I"
"was just made of solid meat – from my pelvis to my neck – with the"
"kidneys wedged in there somewhere. Like a sausage. I dunno."
"Anatomy isn’t my strong point. I like romantic 19th-century novels,"
"where girls faint in the rain, and Spike Milligan’s war memoirs."
"There isn’t much menstruation in either. This all seems a bit …"
"unnecessary."
"‘And it happens every month,’ I say, to Caz. Caz is now actually"
"lying, fully dressed, under her duvet, wearing Wellington boots."
"‘I want you to go away,’ her voice says, from under the duvet."
"‘I’m pretending you’re dead. I can’t think of anything I want to do less"
"than talk about menstruation with you.’"
"I trail away."
"‘Nil desperandum!’ I say to myself. ‘There’s always someone"
"I can go to for a sympathetic ear, and a bowl full of cheery chat!’"

"‘She must have actually dug a hole in the ground, to squat in,’"
"Caz says, in disgust. ‘She must have been gagging for it. Your dog"
"is a whore.’"
"‘I’m going to become a woman soon, dog,’ I say. The dog"
"licks its vagina. I have noticed the dog always does this when I talk"
"to it. I have not yet worked out what I think about this, but I think I"
"might be a bit sad about it."
"‘I found a leaflet, and it says I’ll be starting my periods soon,’ I"
"continue. ‘I’ll be honest, dog – I’m a bit worried. I think it’s going to"
"hurt.’"
"I look into the dog’s eyes. She is as stupid as a barrel of toes."
"Galaxies of nothing are going on in her eyes."
"I get up."
"‘I’m going to talk to Mum,’ I explain. The dog remains under"
"my bed, looking, as always, deeply nervous about being a dog."
"I track Mum down on the toilet. She’s now eight months"
"pregnant, and holding the sleeping one-year-old Cheryl whilst trying"
"to do a wee."
"I sit on the edge of the bath."
"‘Mum?’ I say."
"For some reason, I think I am allowed only one question"
"about this. One shot at the ‘menstrual cycle conversation’."
"‘Yes?’ she answers. Even though she is doing a wee and"
"holding a sleeping baby, she is also sorting out a whites wash from"
"the washing basket."
"‘You know – my period?’ I whisper."
"‘Yes?’ she says"
"‘Will it hurt?’ I ask."
"Mum thinks for a minute."
"‘Yeah,’ she says, in the end. ‘But it’s OK.’"
"The baby then starts crying, so she never explains why it’s"
"‘OK’. It remains unexplained."
"Three weeks later, my period starts. I find it to be a deeply"
"uncheerful event. It starts in the car on the way to Central Library in"
"town, and I have to walk all around the Non-Fiction section for half"
"an hour, desperately hoping it won’t show, before Dad takes us all"
"home again."
"‘My first period started: yuk,’ I write in my diary."
"‘I don’t think Judy Garland ever had a period,’ I tell the dog,"
"unhappily, later that night. I am watching myself cry in a small handmirror. ‘Or Cyd Charisse. Or Gene Kelly.’"
"The bag of Pennywise sanitary towels my mum keeps on the"
"back of the bathroom door has become my business now, too. I feel"
"a sad jealousy of all my younger siblings who are still ‘outside the"
"bag’. The towels are thick, and cheap – stuck into my knickers, they"
"feel like a mattress between my legs."
"‘It feels like a mattress between my legs,’ I tell Caz."
"We’re playing one of our Sindy games. Four hours in, and"
"Caz’s Sindy, Bonnie, is secretly murdering everyone on a luxury"
"cruise ship. My Sindy, Layla, is trying to solve the mystery. The onelegged Action Man, Bernard, is dating both of them simultaneously."
""
"We argue constantly over the ownership of Bernard, even though he"
"actually belongs to Eddie. Neither of us want our Sindy to be single."
"‘A horrible, thick mattress,’ I continue. ‘Like in The Princess"
"and the Pea.’"
"‘How long are they?’ Caz asks."
"Ten minutes later, and six Pennywise sanitary towels are laid"
"out, like a dormitory, with Sindys sleeping on them."
"‘Well, this is lucky!’ I say. ‘Like when we found out that a"
"Brussels sprout looks exactly like a Sindy cabbage. See, Caz – this"
"is the bright side of menstruation!’"
"Because the sanitary towels are cheap, they shred between"
"my thighs when I walk, and become ineffective, and leaky. I give up"
"walking for the duration of my period. My first period lasts three"
"months. I think this is perfectly normal. I faint quite regularly. I"
"become so anaemic my finger- and toenails become very pale blue."
"I don’t tell Mum, because I’ve asked my question about periods."
"Now I just have to get on with them."
"The blood on the sheets is depressing – not dramatic, and"
"red, like a murder, but brown, and tedious, like an accident. It looks"
"like I am rusty inside, and am now breaking. In an effort to avoid"
"handwashing stains out every morning, I take to stuffing huge"
"bundles of loo roll in my knickers, along with the useless sanitary"
"towel, and lying very, very still all night. Sometimes, there are huge"
"bloodclots, that look like raw liver. I presume this is the lining of my"
"womb, coming off in inch-thick slices, and that this is just how"
"visceral menstruation is. It all adds to a dreary sense that"
"something terribly wrong is going on, but that it is against the rules"
"of the game to ever mention it. Frequently, I think about all the"
"women through history, who’ve had to deal with this ferocious"
"bullshit with just rags and cold water."
"No wonder women have been oppressed by men for so long,"
"I think, scouring my pants with a nail-brush and coal-tar soap, in the"
"bathroom. Getting dried blood out of cotton is a bitch. We were all"
"too busy scrubbing to agitate for the vote until the twin-tub was"
"invented."
"Even though she’s two years younger than me, Caz starts her"
"periods six months after me – just as I’m starting my second one."
"She comes crying into my bedroom, when everyone else is asleep,"
"and whispers the awful words, ‘My period’s started.’"
"I show her the bag of sanitary towels, on the back of the"
"bathroom door, and tell her what to do."
"‘Put them in your knickers, and don’t walk for three months,’ I"
"say. ‘It’s easy.’"
"‘Will it hurt?’ she asks, eyes wide."
"‘Yes,’ I say, in an adult and noble manner. ‘But it’s OK.’"
"‘Why is it OK?’ she asks."
"‘I don’t know,’ I say."
"‘Well, why are you saying it, then?’ she asks."
"‘I don’t know.’"
"‘Jesus. Why do you bother talking? The stuff that comes out of"
"your mouth.’"
"Caz gets horrific cramps – she spends her periods in the"
"bedroom with the curtains drawn, covered in hot water bottles,"
"shouting ‘Fuck off’ at anyone who tries to come into the room. As"
"part of being a hippy, my mother doesn’t ‘believe’ in pain-killers, and"
"urges us to research herbal remedies. We read that sage is"
""
"supposed to help, and sit in bed eating handfuls of sage and onion"
"stuffing, crying. Neither of us can believe that we’re going to have to"
"put up with this for the next 30 years."
"‘I don’t want children anyway,’ Caz says. ‘So I am getting"
"nothing out of this whatsoever. I want my entire reproductive system"
"taken out, and replaced with spare lungs, for when I start smoking. I"
"want that option. This is pointless.’"
"At this juncture, it seems there is absolutely nothing to"
"recommend being a woman. Sex hormones are a bitch that have"
"turned me from a blithe child into a bleeding, weeping, fainting"
"washerwoman. These hormones do not make me feel feminine:"
"every night, I lie in bed feeling wretched, and the bulge of my"
"sanitary towel in my knickers looks like a cock."
"I take everything off, sadly, while I get my nightie out of the"
"drawer. When I turn around again, the dog has slunk out from under"
"the bed, and started to eat my bloody sanitary towel. There are bits"
"of shredded, red cotton wool all over the floor, and my knickers are"
"hanging out of her mouth. She stares at me, desperately."
"‘Oh God – your dog’s a lesbian vampire,’ Caz says, from her"
"bed, turning over to sleep."
"I go to retrieve my knickers, and faint."
"In the midst of this hormonal gloom, however, the cavalry finally"
"arrives, over the hill, jangling its spurs, and epaulettes shining in"
"the sun: my green library card. Now I’m 13, I can get adult books out"
"of the library, without having to borrow my parents’ cards. And that"
"means I can get secret books out. Dirty books. Books with sex in."
"‘I’ve been having these dreams,’ I tell the dog, as we walk to"
"the library. The library is on the other side of The Green – a gigantic,"
"desolate stretch of grass, where one must be constantly on the"
"lookout for The Yobs. It doesn’t do to boldly walk in the middle of it –"
"this leaves one exposed. You must stick to the outer edges, near"
"the houses, so that if you get attacked the people who live in the"
"houses can get a good view of you getting your head kicked in"
"without having to fetch their binoculars."
"‘Dreams about … men,’ I continue. I look at the dog. The dog"
"looks back at me. I think the dog deserves to know the whole truth of"
"what is going on here. I owe her that much, at least."
"‘I’m in love with Chevy Chase,’ I tell the dog, in a sudden,"
"joyful burst. ‘I saw him in the video to Paul Simon’s “Call Me Al”,"
"from the 1986 Graceland album, on Warner Bros., and I just can’t"
"stop thinking about him. I had this dream where he kissed me, and"
"his mouth felt exciting. I’m going to ask Dad if we can get The Three"
"Amigos out of the video shop on Friday.’"
"Requesting The Three Amigos from the video shop will be a"
"bold move – the next video for rental has already been earmarked"
"as Howard the Duck. I will have to pull a lot of fancy footwork but it"
"will be worth it. I have not told the dog yet but the thought of kissing"
"Chevy Chase has made me so excited that, yesterday, I listened to"
"‘Call Me Al’ 16 times on repeat, imagining him touching my face"
"while Paul Simon plays the bass solo. I am so hot for Chevy. I have"
"even imagined what my first line to him will be – the one that will"
"capture his heart."
"‘Chevy Chase?’ I will say, at a party very closely modelled on"
"the ones I’ve seen in Dynasty. ‘Any relation to Cannock Chase?’"
""
"Cannock Chase is just off the A5 to Stafford. LA-born movie"
"star and comedian Chevy is going to both get, and love, this joke."
"Of course, I have had crushes before. Well, one. It didn’t go"
"very well. When I was seven, I saw an episode of Buck Rogers, and"
"fell in love with that dumb American space-cowboy, so obviously"
"based on Han Solo they might as well have called him San Holo"
"and had him ride around in the Fillennium Malcon, with Bewchacca."
"As the new love-chemicals rushed through me – Bucknesium"
"and Rogertonin – I discovered what love is, and found that it’s just"
"feeling very … interested. More interested than I had been about"
"anything before."
"I was interested in absolutely everything to do with Buck. Just"
"looking at his face was interesting. How he stood, near a door ="
"interesting. The way he held the obviously lightweight and plastic"
"laser gun as if it were very heavy = interesting. The theme tune"
"takes on such an unbearable load of yearning and Buck Rogerness"
"that – 28 years later – I still feel stirred when I hear it."
"Obviously, these were all some big-assed feelings to be"
"dealing with, and so I did what we always did when an event of"
"some import is going on. I grabbed Caz – then five – and pulled her"
"into the airing cupboard with me. Like the Mitfords used to – except"
"theirs was probably much larger than ours, and didn’t smell of Bold,"
"mouse droppings and farts."
"‘Caz,’ I said, pulling the door as shut as I could, and"
"assuming an expression of deep portent. ‘I have something"
"incredible to tell you.’"
"I paused, staring at her."
"‘I … am IN LOVE, with Buck Rogers. Don’t tell Mum.’"
"Caz nodded."
"My burden lifted, I opened the door again, and gestured for"
"Caz to leave. I watched her cross the landing and go down the"
"stairs. I heard her open the front room door."
"‘Mum. Cate’s in love with Buck Rogers,’ she said."
"I learn then, in that moment – as mortification burns across"
"me like hot ash – that love is agony, all crushes should remain"
"secret, and that Caz was an untrustworthy, faint-hearted son of a"
"bitch."
"All these facts stood me in good stead, subsequently. I"
"learned a lot in the airing cupboard that day. Just 20 minutes later, I"
"was stuffing frozen peas into Caz’s pillowcase whilst whispering,"
"portentously, ‘And so the war begins.’"
"But – having crushed all feelings of love for so long – the onrush of"
"adolescent hormones have made it now impossible to ignore them"
"any longer. The 13-year-old girl with her hair in plaits, edging"
"around The Green, talking to her pregnant dog, is actually crazed"
"with lust."

"at the picture of Chevy, and then copy it into my Love Book.’"

"vest and hide it at the back of my knicker drawer, so my parents"
"don’t see it. It’s very important my parents don’t think I’m starting to"
"fall in love with people, because then they might notice that I’m"
"growing up, and I’m kind of trying to keep it secret. I think it will"
"cause some kind of incident."
"At the library, I find the novelisation of Fletch easily. It has a"
"satisfyingly big picture of Chevy on the cover – I am going to wear"
"down some pencil lead copying out that sweet face."
"Almost as an afterthought, I put Riders by Jilly Cooper onto the"
"countertop, to be stamped out. It’s got a horse on the front. I like"
"horses. I can hear the dog whining outside. I’ve tied her to a tree,"
"but she often fusses around, and kind of lynches herself with the"

"breathing."
"Three hours later, and I cannot believe what I am reading. My first"
"day of getting adult books out, and I have struck filth gold. Absolute"
"filth gold. Riders by Jilly Cooper is more than I could ever have"
"dreamed of – there’s cocks, tits and shagging everywhere. Clits"
"falling from the sky. Arses two feet deep. A hurricane of nipples,"
"blowjobs and muff-diving."
"Some of it’s confusing – Cooper keeps referring to one"
"heroine’s ‘bush’, and until I get to page 130, I can’t swear with"
"absolute certainty that she’s not talking about vegetation. And I have"

"concentration – and determinedly try everything, in this absolutely"
"unfamiliar place I have had for 13 years."

"she writes comments – ‘You’re so pathetic’ – in the margins, when"

"Some afternoons, I lock myself in my bedroom and come for"
"hours and hours and hours – until my fingertips are as wrinkled as"

"wonder if everyone knows about it. Perhaps there would be"
"revolution if they did! I can’t wait to tell everyone, except I will never"
"tell anyone, because this is the biggest secret ever. Even more"
"secret than periods, or the fact I have spots on my bum."
"I tell the dog, of course, and the dog, as is her wont, licks her"

"know anything about this.’"

"Over the next few years, masturbation becomes a time-consuming"

"is called ‘masturbation’, I never call it that myself. ‘Masturbation’"
"sounds too much like ‘perturbation’, and this is, by and large, a very"

"Instead, she took on a sadly chiding tone. ‘Things have rather"

"exciting. So long as your cast have been recruited from neither a"

"disappointingly, there to satisfy a kink. If it were, I could argue it until"
"the cows literally came home. Nah – it seems to me that the real"

"As a result, we’re at risk of a situation in which every boy"
"expects to undress a girl and find a thorough wax job, and every girl"

"13 coming in for Brazilians – removing the first signs of adulthood"
"even as they appear, in a combination that – with its overtones of"

"consummate the marriage. Bloody hell. Aside from every"
"conceivable, dolorous psychosexual side effect, it saddens me that"

"really important stuff: hair dye, tights, Jilly Cooper paperbacks, the"

"Lying in a hammock, gently finger-combing your Wookiee"

"hand off it, as if it were a tiny hair trampoline."
"Walking around a room, undressed, in front of appreciative"
"eyes, the reflection in the mirror shows the right thing: a handful of"
"darkness between your legs, something you refuse to hurt. Half"
"animal, half secret – something to be approached with a measure"
"of reverence, rather than just made to lie there, while cocks are"
"chucked at it like the penultimate game on It’s A Knockout."
"And on proper spa days, you can pop a bit of conditioner on it,"

"‘But what about underarm hair?’ people will say – usually 40something men, who look uncomfortable when you use phrases"
"such as ‘lovely big Hair Bear Bunch-style minge’, and then"

"‘If you don’t believe in Brazilians, do you shave your armpits?"
"Do you shave your legs? And your eyebrows? You look like you"

"But the crotch, the upper lip and the armpit are miles apart –"

"you’re on some seriously specialist websites."
"So what you do with your armpits it just an aesthetic concern –"
"and not really part of The Struggle. Given this, I have, over the years,"

"match, and cracked out the Crazy Colours. ‘I shall be red in foof and"
"maw!’, I thought to myself, cheerily, slapping on the crème."

"‘No one wants to hear “I love you” from someone with purple"

"When it comes to hair – legs, upper lip, eyebrows, chin,"

"Having shaved my first, scared, lonely pube off, at the age of 13, I"
"continue to remove all my pubic hair for three further months, and"
"then stop. There are a number of reasons."
"1) As they become more numerous, picking them out of"
"dad’s razor – so I can replace it on the shelf, ostensibly"
"untouched – becomes more and more difficult. My"
"fingertips are covered in a criss-cross of tiny razorblade"
"scars, as if I’ve decided to replace my fingerprints with"
"something more angular, or am attempting the least"
"effective self-harming session ever. Cleaning out a"
"razor is dangerous. A 13-year-old shouldn’t be doing it."
"2) It’s itchy. Insanely itchy. The regrowth appears to be"
"made of three-parts asbestos, one-part artisan mohair,"
"and drives me to distraction. Three weeks in, and I’m"
"scratching like I’ve caught the pox – which is ironic,"
"because the final reason I abandon shaving is:"
"3) The realisation no one is going to see what’s going"
"on there for years. YEARS. Since the terrible day of"
"Bergerac, I now dress – shiveringly cold – in the"
"bedroom. There will be no more putting my nightie on in"
"front of my family. In front of anyone at all. As my friend,"
"Bad Paul, will put it, in years to come: ‘What you look like"
"undressed? That’s scarcely something you need worry"
"about, dear.’ The idea of a 13-year-old virgin shaving off"
"her pubic hair is as ridiculous as Neil Armstrong"
"splashing on aftershave before setting foot on the"
"moon: any audience for the effort is entirely imaginary. I"
"let it all grow back, in peace, and leave my father’s razor"
"next to the eye-bath, and the lotion. I move on to the next"
"incident on puberty’s agenda."
"The next time anyone sees me naked, I am 17, losing my virginity in"
"a bedsit in Stockwell, South London, to a man with steady eyes,"

"wants to take my green dress off, and lie me down."

"I Don’t Know What To Call My"
"Breasts!"
"Of course, I know that adolescence is supposed to be an incredible"
"… unfolding. I’ve spent my time in the library. I’ve read Gray’s"
"Anatomy, cruising for the juicy bits. I can quote chapter and verse on"
"adolescent neural development – on how when the sex hormones"
"kick in, the teenage brain, essentially, explodes. White matter –"
"wire-like fibres – establishes motorways of reason. The brain lights"
"up like the Eastern Seaboard at dusk – lights flashing on and off in"
"ripples; starbursts; spirals; waves. At 14, I am an experiment."
"Inside, I am being resurrected. I am in the middle of the kind of"
"explosion of perspective that, in later years, I will pay a great deal of"
"money to emulate in nightclubs, and at parties, in toilets – counting"
"out tenners for pills in order to feel a tenth this remorseless,"
"expanded and inspired."
"I read the biographies of age-contemporaries, and boggle."
"Bobby Fischer was Chess Grandmaster at 15. Picasso was"
"exhibiting at 15. Kate Bush writes ‘The Man With The Child In His"
"Eyes’ aged 14 – so young, the child in his eyes might actually have"
"been her own reflection. I have – as with any other teenager – the"
"potential to take my place in the world, the equal, or better, of any"
"adult. I could be a fucking genius."
"That’s the theory, anyway. And, to be fair, I am aware of it: my"
"diary records that I am using this unprecedented expansion of my"
"mental capacity to chew over some fairly major questions and"
"concepts: ‘Wish I could cry forever. It would be such a relief.’ ‘Am I"
"one of the wrong people?’ ‘Some days, I feel like I can do"
"ANYTHING! I know I am here to, in some small way, save the"
"WORLD!’ ‘Would wearing a hat make me look thinner? Seriously?’"
"and, on 14 March 1990, ‘I have found the meaning of life: Squeeze."
"Cool For Cats! BRILLO!’"
"But, to be honest, I’m generally too busy fire-fighting all the"
"physical stuff to pay much attention to my brain, or my potential for"
"prodigious genius. Man, it’s going nuts. There’s crazy shit breaking"
"out all over the place. Bleeding and masturbatory experimentation"
"are the very least of it. The transformation of my body from"
"something that does little more than poo and do jigsaws into a"
"magical department store that will, one day, vend babies takes up"
"nearly all my time and worry."
"One morning, I wake up to find that my entire body is covered"
"in livid red marks – like the raspberry-ripple streaks across my belly,"
"thighs, breasts, underarms and calves. At first I presume it’s a rash,"
"and walk around for two days smothered in Sudocrem – baby"
"nappy-rash ointment – in the hope that it will soothe them. When my"
"mother notices her supplies are running low, she accuses the twoyear-old Cheryl of having eaten it again and I, nobly, don’t correct"
"her."
"But when I examine the marks more closely – door locked,"
"using an anglepoise lamp, listening to ‘Cool For Cats’ very loudly,"
"for moral support – I see that they aren’t welts at all, but"

"indentations. My skin has torn as I’ve grown – these are stretchmarks, covering nearly every soft part of my body. Puberty is like a"
"lion that has raked me with its claws as I try to outrun it. Or, as I put it"
"to Caz that night, ‘I am going to have to wear tights and polo-necks"
"for the REST of my LIFE. Even in summer. I’m going to have to"
"pretend I’m just always very cold. That’s going to have to be the"
"thing everyone knows about me. That I’m cold.’"
"Caz and I have hit a rare moment of peace in our relationship."
"Two days ago, we spontaneously hugged each other. My mother"
"was so shocked and alarmed she took a photo of us, to mark the"
"occasion. I still have it now – both of us in matching dressing"
"gowns, barefoot, faces pressed together in expressions of 98 per"
"cent goodwill, 2 per cent festering aggression. Our mother thinks"
"that we have, finally, bonded – brought together by the combined"
"responsibility of being the eldest two siblings of seven children –"
"able to now settle our differences as the adults we are swiftly"
"becoming."
"Why we’re actually hugging is because we’ve just had a twohour-long conversation about what to call our vaginas."
"‘I can’t say it,’ I say, to Caz. We’re in the bedroom – me on my"
"bed, her on the floor. We’re listening to ‘Cool For Cats’ for the ninth"
"time that morning. The tape is already wearing thin – Chris Difford’s"
"voice now wobbles a bit as the Indians send signals from the rocks,"
"above the pass. Caz is knitting a jumper, in order to have something"
"to wear."
"‘I think I’d rather pretend I don’t have one at all than say"
"“vagina”,’ I continue. ‘If I injure myself, and end up in a very formal"
"hospital where they don’t allow slang words and they ask, “Where is"
"the pain?” I think that, rather than say “In my vagina” I would just"
"reply “Guess!”, and then faint. I hate the word vagina.’"
"‘It was so much easier last year,’ Caz agrees, sadly."
"Until last year, all the Moran children were labouring under the"
"illusion that the word ‘navel’ didn’t refer to the belly button, but, in"
"fact, the female genitalia. Any injury to the area would result in the"
"shriek, ‘I banged my NAVEL!’, and communal sympathy. One"
"corollary of this was finding the phrase ‘naval officer’ almost"
"unbearably amusing. When Prince Andrew married Sarah"
"Ferguson, and was referred to as ‘a naval officer’ during the"
"ceremony on BBC1 by Jonathan Dimbleby, we became so"
"hysterical we had to lie, upside down, on the stairs, until the blood"
"went back into our heads."
"Additionally – for a short period, in 1987 – our little sister"
"Weena mispronounced ‘vagina’ as ‘china’, and we used that word,"
"for a spell. Then, in the autumn, T’Pau released the Number One"
"single ‘China In Your Hand’, and, once again, we all had to lie"
"upside down on the stairs until our circulations went back to"
"normal. Entering a shop where it was playing was borderline"
"dangerous. We would have to run out, with our hoods up, shaking."
"So now, in 1989, we have no word for ‘vagina’ at all – and with"
"all the stuff that’s going on down there, we feel we need one. We sit"
"in silence, thoughtfully, for a moment."
"‘We could call them Rolfs,’ Caz says, eventually. ‘Like Rolf"
"Harris? They look like his beard.’"
"We stare at each other. We both know that Rolf Harris is not"
"the answer we are looking for."
"The problem with the word ‘vagina’ is that vaginas seem to be"
""
"just straight-out bad luck. Only a masochist would want one,"
"because only awful things happen to them. Vaginas get torn."
"Vaginas get ‘examined’. Evidence is found in them. Serial killers"
"leave things in them, to taunt Morse – like they’re the shelf in the"
"hallway, where you leave your keys and spare change. No one"
"wants one of those."
"No. Let’s clear this up right now – I don’t actually have a"
"vagina. I never have. Indeed, I reckon very few women ever have."
"Queen Victoria, obviously. Barbara Castle. Margaret Thatcher. With"
"the pubic hair styled, of course, in an exact replica of that on her"
"head."
"But everyone else – no. Because I’m scarcely the only one. No"
"one I know would refer to their vagina as their ‘vagina’. They have"
"slang names, pet names, made-up names – family names for the"
"front parlour that have been passed down from generation to"
"generation. When I asked on Twitter for people’s childhood"
"appellations, I got over 500 replies in 20 minutes – a great"
"percentage of them totally, dementedly barking. It was like I’d"
"opened up a Pandora’s Box of Minge. The first one I got set the"
"tone: ‘My childhood best friend’s mum referred to it as “ducky”, and"
"periods as “duck’s disease”.’"
"This is, clearly, a train of thought uninterrupted – possibly for"
"generations – by any outside influence. It’s lexical inbreeding."
"The range was immense. Some were quite lovely and/or"
"amusing: your flower, your tuppence, pickle, tissy, Mary, flump, putt,"
"tuchas, minny, pum-pum, tinkle, fairy, foof, my lady, woowoo, bits"
"and pieces, muffin, cupcake, and pocket."

"family in-joke: Valerie, Aunty Helen, pasta shell, bumgina, fandango,"
"Yorkshire Pudding (‘She would cry, “I’ve got sand in my Yorkshire!”’),"
"Under Henge, and Birmingham City Centre."
"And then there were the downright bizarre and/or worrying:"
"your difference, your secret, your problem, Sweet Fanny Adams"
"(nickname of a murdered Victorian child; not a great day at the"

"Jews can never utter the Tetragrammaton – and must make do with"

"When Lizzie was just a few days old – around the time the first"
"kilo of morphine wore off, and I could focus again, but, to be frank,"
"still a good two weeks before I could sit down without screaming"
"‘HOLY MARY I THINK IT’S BROKEN!’ – my husband and I stared"
"down at our beautiful little daughter. Blue-eyed, kissy-mouthed and"
"soft as a velvet mouse, she had just done a dump so enormous, it"
"had filled every crevice of her lower body."
"My husband approached her nethers, tentatively, with a wetwipe, and then slumped back, looking defeated."
"‘Not only have I got to clean all … this out,’ he said, looking on"
"the verge of mania, ‘but I don’t even know what I’m cleaning. What"

"TO CALL HER VAGINA?’"
"Over the next few weeks, we brainstormed over the issue, like"
"ad executives blue-skying the ad campaign for a new hamflavoured"
"yoghurt."
"‘It looks like a ladybird,’ my husband said, during one"
"particularly fanciful moment. ‘We could call it her ladybird!’"

"Goes Bananas” to each other over and over again, as you build the"
"doorless turret we can lock her in.’"
"Another week, my husband came up with ‘Baby Gap’ – ‘It’s"
"her baby gap!’ – which was not only a great joke, but also meant"
"that putting her in a T-shirt or jumper with the ‘Baby Gap’ logo on it"
"prompted valuable minutes of roflment."
"In the event, though, that name lived fast and died young – we"

"around 12 these days; it appears to be the slightly more grown-up"

"I Am A Feminist!"
"In The Female Eunuch, Germaine Greer suggests that the reader"
"take a moment to taste their menstrual blood. ‘If you haven’t tasted it"
"yet, you’ve got a long way to go, baby,’ she says."
"Well, I cannot help but agree. You have to try everything once –"
"even eating sweet and sour prawns from a dodgy-looking takeaway"
"van in Leicester, or wearing a puffball skirt. I have, of course, tasted"
"my own menstrual blood. By and large, I’d prefer a bag of Nik Naks,"
"but it was all right: better than most stuff you can buy on an Inter-city"
"buffet, and certainly an ethically sound product. My welfare of me"
"has been exemplary. I always have clean, deep hay to sleep on."
"Personally, however, I will not be urging you to taste your"
"menstrual blood right now, as I’m very aware you might be on a"
"bus, or sitting at the back of the Tick Tock Toddlers club, making"
"desultory small-talk with a woman called ‘Barb’. As with so many"
"‘empowering’ things – doing a parachute jump, learning bellydancing, getting a tattoo – tasting your menstrual blood would be,"
"let’s face it, just another thing to add to the ‘To Do’ list, along with"
"getting that curtain pole mended, de-fleaing the cats, and sewing"
"that button back on your coat which, now you come to think of it, fell"
"off in 2003."
"No, ladies, rest easy. You will not have to taste your menses"
"today. Not on my watch."
"What I AM going to urge you to do, however, is say ‘I am a"
"feminist’. For preference, I would like you to stand on a chair, and"
"shout ‘I AM A FEMINIST’ – but this is simply because I believe"
"everything is more exciting if you stand on a chair to do it."
"It really is important you say these words out loud. ‘I AM A"
"FEMINIST.’ If you feel you cannot say it – not even stading on the"
"ground – I would be alarmed. It’s probably one of the most"
"important things a woman will ever say: the equal of ‘I love you’, ‘Is it"
"a boy or a girl?’ or ‘No! I’ve changed my mind! Do NOT cut me a"
"fringe!’"
"Say it. SAY IT! SAY IT NOW! Because if you can’t, you’re"
"basically bending over, saying, ‘Kick my arse and take my vote,"
"please, the patriarchy.’"
"And do not think you shouldn’t be standing on that chair,"
"shouting ‘I AM A FEMINIST!’ if you are a boy. A male feminist is one"
"of the most glorious end-products of evolution. A male feminist"
"should ABSOLUTELY be on the chair – so we ladies may all toast"
"you, in champagne, before coveting your body wildly. And maybe get"
"you to change that light bulb, while you’re up there. We cannot do it"
"ourselves. There is a big spider’s web on the fitting."
"I was 15 when I first said, ‘I am a feminist.’ Here I am in my"
"bedroom, saying it. I am looking in the mirror, watching myself say"
"it: ‘I am a feminist. I am a feminist.’"
"It is now nearly three years since I wrote my ‘Things To Do By"
"The Time I Am 18’ list, and I am slowly piecing together a vague"
"plan of who I should be. I still haven’t got my ears pierced, lost any"
"weight or trained the dog, and all my clothes are still awful. My"
"second-best top is a T-shirt with a cartoon of an alligator holding a"

"I still don’t have any friends, either. Not one – unless you"
"count family, which obviously you don’t, because they just come free"
"with your life, wanted or not, like the six-page Curry’s brochure that"
"falls out of the local paper, advertising Spectrum 128k home"
"computers, and ‘ghetto blasters’. No. Family doesn’t count at all."
"But on the plus side, I am not alone because – as with a"
"million lonely girls and boys before – books, TV and music are"
"looking after me now. I am being raised by witches, wolves and"
"unexpected guest stars on Wogan. All art is someone trying to tell"
"you something, I realise. There’s thousands of people who want to"
"talk to me, so long as I open their book, or turn on their show. These"
"are a trillion telegrams with important information and tips. It may be"
"bad information, or a misconstrued tip – but at least you are getting"
"some data on what it’s like out there. Your CNN ticker-tape is"
"running full blast. You are getting input."
"Books seem the most potent source: each one is the sum"
"total of a life that can be inhaled in a single day. I read fast, so I’m"
"hoovering up lives at a ferocious pace; six or seven or eight in a"
"week. I particularly love autobiographies: I can eat a whole person"
"by sun-down. I’m reading about Welsh hill farmers and female"
"round-the-world yachtswomen, World War Two soldiers and"
"housekeepers in pre-war Shropshire mansions, journalists and"
"movie stars, screenwriters, Tudor princes and 17th-century prime"
"ministers."
"And every book, you find, has its own social group – friends of"
"its own it wants to introduce you to, like a party in the library that"
"need never, ever end. When I first meet David Niven’s The Moon’s a"
"Balloon, it keeps on mentioning Harpo Marx, until – when I finally"
"bump into him, on the ‘Autobiographies: M’ shelf – we get on like a"
"house on fire. I’m soon up to speed with how Marx spends his"
"afternoons: at the Algonquin Round Table in New York, which is by"
"way of a pre-war Valhalla for cocktail-drinking dandies with"
"typewriters. Robert Benchley and Robert E. Sherwood and"
"Alexander Woollcott – who stirs in me a lifelong affection for camp,"
"waspy men who show their love with increasingly vile insults"
"(‘Hello, Repulsive’)."
"Finally, through Woollcott, I come face to face with the holy"
"Dorothy Parker, who I feel has been waiting for me forever, in 1923,"
"with her lipstick and her cigarettes and her glorious, whiplash"
"despair. Dorothy Parker is monumentally important because, it"
"seems to me at the time, she is the first woman who has ever been"
"capable of being funny: an evolutionary step for women as major as"
"the development of the opposable thumb, or the invention of the"
"wheel. Parker is funny in the 1920s and then – I am led to believe –"
"no other women are funny until French and Saunders and Victoria"
"Wood come along, in the eighties. Parker is the Eve of female"
"humour."
"Robert Johnson invented the blues, at midnight, at a"
"crossroads, after selling his soul to the devil. Dorothy Parker"
"invented amusing women, at 2pm, in New York’s best cocktail bar,"
"after tipping a bus-boy 50 cents for a Martini. It’s hard not to draw"
"conclusions as to which is the brighter sex."

"But Parker also worries me, because half the funny stuff she"
"writes is about killing herself: funny doesn’t seem to be working out"
"as well for her as it does for, say, Ben Elton. And it cannot be"
"ignored that it takes nearly 60 years for any women to be funny"
"again after her. The trail she blazed stayed notably untrodden. I start"
"to worry that women are, as the rumour has it, not as good as men,"
"after all."
"In the same month I read Parker’s ‘Résumé’ – ‘Razors pain"
"you/Rivers are damp/Acids stain you/And drugs cause cramp/Guns"
"aren’t lawful/Nooses give/Gas smells awful/You might as well live’"
"– I start reading Sylvia Plath, who everyone agrees is one of the few"
"women who can write as well as a man, but who also keeps trying"
"to kill herself: always crashing in the same car, or overdosing. This"
"is worrying. I’m in the middle of being obsessed with Bessie Smith,"
"whose life is raddled with heroin. I adore Janis Joplin, who sixties"
"herself to death. And, increasingly, people are being horrible about"
"the Duchess of York, just because she’s ginger."
"I can’t help but note that most of the women who hold their"
"own with the men seem unhappy, and apt to die young. Lazy,"
"popular opinion has it that this is because women are"
"fundamentally unsuited to putting their head over the parapet and"
"competing on the same terms as men. They just can’t handle the"
"big-boy stuff. They simply need to stop trying."
"But when I look at their undoing – despair, self-loathing, low"
"self-esteem, exhaustion, frustration at repeated lack of opportunity,"
"space, understanding, support or context – to me it seems as if they"
"are all dying of the same thing: being stuck in the wrong century. All"
"these earlier ages are poisonous to women, I begin to think. I knew"
"it before – but just as quiet, accepted fact. I know it again now – but"
"this time, as loud, outraged fact."
"They are surrounded by men, without a team or a den mother"
"to cheer them on. They are the sole pair of high heels clacking"
"through a room of brogues. They are loaded with all the"
"wearisomeness of being a novelty. They are furious and exhausted"
"from having to explain to the men what the women have known all"
"along. They are astronauts in the Mir Space Station, or hearts sewn"
"into early transplant patients. They can pioneer, yes, but it’s not"
"sustainable. Eventually, the body rejects them. The atmosphere"
"proves too thin. It doesn’t work."
"And so, finally, just when I need her, I find Germaine Greer. I"
"know roughly what she’s about, of course – whenever my mother"
"hazards a guess at what might be wrong with the car, my father"
"replies, sighingly, ‘All right, Germaine Greer. Give it a rest’ – but I’ve"
"never actually encountered Greer. I’ve never read anything she’s"
"written, or seen her speak. I presume she is a stern, shouting thing,"
"always pointing out the ‘right’ thing to do: like a nun, but angry."
"Then I see her on TV. I don’t know what programme it is – my"
"diary doesn’t say – but it notes the day with a garland of exclamation"
"marks. ‘I’ve just seen Germaine Greer on TV – she’s NICE!!!!!!!’ I"
"write. ‘FUNNEEEE!!!!!’"
"Greer uses the words ‘liberation’ and ‘feminism’ and I realise"
"– at the age of 15 – that she is the first person I’ve ever seen who"
"doesn’t say them sarcastically, or tempered with invisible quote"
"marks. She doesn’t say them like they are words that are both"
"slightly distasteful, and slightly dangerous, and should be handled"
"only at the end of tongs, like night soil, or typhus."
""
"Instead, Greer says ‘I am a feminist’ in a perfectly calm,"
"logical and entitled way. It sounds like the solution to a puzzle that’s"
"been going on for years. Greer says it with entitlement and pride:"

"history, fought to win. This is the vaccine against the earlier"
"pioneers’ failure. This is the atmosphere that would sustain us all"

"what will keep us alive."
"Aweek later, and I, too, am saying ‘I am a feminist’, into the mirror. I"
"am smoking a pretend cigarette made of rolled-up toilet paper. I"
"blow imaginary smoke away, like Lauren Bacall, and say, ‘I’m a"
"feminist, Humphrey Bogart.’"
"The word feels even more exciting than swearing. It is"
"intoxicating. It makes my head swim."
"I know I am a feminist now, because – after seeing Greer on"
"TV and liking her – I have just read The Female Eunuch. I haven’t"
"been drawn to it solely for its promise of emancipation – I must"
"admit, I am also looking for sex scenes. I know it is – as Eulalie"
"McKecknie Shinn refers to the poetry of Balzac in The Music Man – ‘a"
"SMUTTY book’. Look: the cover has tits on. There should definitely"
"be shagging inside."

"someone raised on rock music, is that Greer writes about being a"
"woman the way men sing about being men. When Bowie describes"
"Ziggy in ‘Ziggy Stardust’ – ‘He was the nazz/with God-given ass/He"
"took it all too far/But boy could he play guitar’ – it might as well have"

"Subsequently, The Female Eunuch is like someone running"

"someone working at the top of their game. And she has the heartin-mouth glee of knowing she is saying stuff no one’s said before."
"She knows she was the new weather front; the coming storm."
"I don’t understand half of what she is on about. At the age of"
"15, I have yet to come across anything I could call sexism in the"
"workplaces, men’s loathing for women or, indeed, what had driven"
"me to the book in the first place: a penis looking to be stimulated"

"lawn with Matthew Vale, smoking."
"Matt is – by both his own, and several independent"
"adjudicators’ assessments – the coolest adolescent in"
"Wolverhampton. He’s got the entire Byrds back catalogue and a lot"
"of baggy charity-shop jumpers, and when he dances he has proper"
"moves; some of which he’s copied off the Supremes. One of his"
"earliest lectures to me was how you should ‘always have a plan’"
"when you walk onto a dance floor."
"‘Don’t just go on there and … fuck around,’ he will say,"
"smoking his fag. ‘Tell a little story.’ It is good advice. Matt has lots of"
"good advice. Another piece he gives me is: ‘Try not to be a total"
"dick.’ Once you’ve been told it, it’s amazing to note how many"
"people appear not to have been told it. It is wise counsel."
"When you first meet Matt, he tells you – as he pulls his fringe"
"over his eyes – that he keeps his fringe over his eyes because he"
"had a bad acid trip, and can’t look anyone in the eye. ‘Because"
"sometimes, I worry that when people look me in the eye, they see"
"that I’m a demon.’"
"After I’ve known him for six months, I one day see him lying on"
"a bed, with his hair swept back. And I realise that it’s actually"
"because he has a little bit of a squint, and doesn’t want anyone to"
"see it."
"Yes of course I fancy him. God I fancy him. I didn’t until my"
"friend Jools saw him up town and exclaimed, on the phone"
"afterwards, ‘Who was HE? He. Was. FIT. AS.’"
"Previously, I’d prided myself on our brotherly/sisterly vibe. After"
"hearing the howling lust in Jools’s voice, however, I stopped kidding"
"myself, and acknowledged that he was six foot two, and fucking buff"
"under the baggy jumpers, and had eyes as green as a dragon’s."
"When I thought about kissing him, I would reflect on how prettily"
"pink, like a girl’s, his mouth was. How I would have to eat it so"
"carefully, to make it last. His mouth was so small. It filled up half of"
"my head. I was 16 I was 16 I was 16, and he was 19, and we are on"
"St Peter’s cathedral lawn, smoking fags."
"This day we are smoking fags is late October. It is two months"
"after we first met – on an adult education course, for film-making, on"
"which we were both immediately and consistently lacklustre – and"
"this is the first day out we have had together, alone. We are"
"basically now auditioning each other, as friends."

"And Matt says:"
"‘Did you have a nickname at school?’"

"hahaha. I thought I’d hidden those extra four stones really carefully,"

"were blue, and I’d kept it secret. I thought he might not have noticed"

"I’ve said it – there, I’ve said it. Because I am 16, 16, 16 and 16"
"stone. All I do is sit around eating bread and cheese, and reading."
"I’m fat. We’re all fat. The entire family is obese."
"We don’t have any full-length mirrors in the house, so"
"whenever I want to see myself naked, I have to go up town, to Marks"
"& Spencer, and pretend that I’m going to try on a tartan skirt, and go"
"into the changing room, and look at myself there."
"I am a virgin, and I don’t play sport, or move heavy objects, or"

"pale thing. There it is, standing awkwardly in the mirror, looking like"

"Because I am fully aware of what the word ‘fat’ means – what it"
"really means, when you say it, or think it. It’s not just a simple,"
"descriptive word like ‘brunette’ or ‘34’."
"It’s a swearword. It’s a weapon. It’s a sociological subspecies. It’s an accusation, dismissal and rejection. When Matt"
"asks if they used to call me ‘Fatty’ at school, he’s already imagining"

"In my family, my fat family, none of us ever say the word ‘fat’."
"‘Fat’ is the word you hear shouted in the playground, or on the street"
"– it’s never allowed over the threshold of the house. My mum won’t"
"have that filth in her house. At home, together, we are safe. It’s like"
"an eruv for the slow and soft. There will be no harm to our feelings"
"here because we never acknowledge fat exists. We never refer to"
"our size. We are the elephants in the room."
"But the silence is the most oppressive thing of all. Because"
"there’s a silent, shrugging, stoical acceptance of all the things in the"
"world we can never be part of: shorts, swimming pools, strappy"
"dresses, country walks, roller-skating, ra-ra skirts, vest tops, high"
"heels, rope climbing, sitting on a high stool, walking past building"
"sites, flirting, being kissed, feeling confident."
"And ever losing weight, ever."
"The idea of suggesting we don’t have to be fat – that things"
"could change – is the most distant and alien prospect of all. We’re"
"fat now and we’ll be fat forever and we must never, ever mention it,"
"and that is the end of it. It’s like Harry Potter’s Sorting Hat. We were"
"pulled from the hat marked ‘Fat’ and that is what we must now"
"remain, until we die. Fat is our race. Our species. Our mode."
"As a result, there is very little of the outside world – and very"
"little of the year – we can enjoy. Summer is sweaty under selfconscious layers. On stormy days, wind flattens skirts against"
"thighs, and alarms both us and, we think, onlookers and passersby."
"Winter is the only time we feel truly comfortable: covered head"
"to toe in jumpers, coats, boots and hat. I develop a crush on Father"
"Christmas. If I married him, not only would I be expected to stay fat,"
"but I’d look thin standing next to him, in comparison. Perspective"
"would be my friend. We all dream of moving to Norway, or Alaska,"
"where we could wear massive padded coats all the time, and never"
"reveal an inch of flesh. When it rains, we’re happiest of all. Then we"
"can just stay in, away from everyone, in our pyjamas, and not worry"
"about anything. The brains in jars can stay inside, nice and dry."
"When Matty Vale asks me if I used to be called Fatty, I am"
"wearing my swimsuit from when I was 12 under my clothes – by"
"way of a primitive and ultimately ineffective corset – and I have been"
"painfully holding my stomach in since gone midday."
"‘No!’ I say. I give an imperious, Ava Gardner-like flash of"

"The band listen, politely, but they clearly wish he’d stop."
"‘Woo! It’s a spontaneous happening! I can review it!’ I say,"
"trying to move the mood on."

"‘Not unless you’ve learned how to write yet,’ Courtney replies,"
"strumming a G minor, and puffing on a fag. I’m so embarrassed"
"that I take Ecstasy, just for something to do with my face."
"As the E warms up inside, and the rest of the room melts, I"
"see Caz is quietly watching me. Before today, I haven’t seen her for"
"months – so long I’d almost forgotten who I am when I’m with her."
"Her face becomes a mirror: I can see reflected in it a teenage girl"
"with blasted pupils, sitting alone on a chair, looking very, very tired,"
"even though I am talking fast."
"She is a true mirror, I think. I should look into her more often. I"
"can see myself in there. I can see my good points and my bad"
"points – but I recognise that face. I feel like I haven’t seen that face"
"in a long, long time. Not since I was a child."
"We stare at each other for an age – just good, old-fashioned"
"off-your-face staring."
"In the end, Caz just raises an eyebrow at me. I know what"
"she’s saying. She’s saying: ‘What?’"
"I mouth back: ‘I hate him.’"
"She mouths back: ‘That’s because he’s a knob-skin. They’re"
"all knob-skins.’"
"I go and sit next to Caz, on the floor. We sit there for what"
"seems like an age, watching Courtney, and the band, and some"
"giggling girls who seem to have appeared from nowhere."
"Rhythms and patterns establish themselves in the room."
"Circles of people curling forward, like chrysanthemum petals, over"
"cocaine – then exploding outwards, into nose-rubbing, and violent"
"chat. Slow kissing in corners – then triumphal returns to the throng."
"People face to face with guitars, Beatles-style, starting a song –"
"then suddenly stopping, with barks of laughter, before another"
"starts again."
"Caz and I have maracas. We are shaking them in a manner"
"that can only be described as ‘sarcastic percussion’. Every so often,"
"someone asks us to stop – but we just start again, very quietly, a"
"minute later. It’s making us happy."
"Sitting on the floor, in the corner, everything else looks like a"
"scene happening on a television. It looks like a play. Until I came"
"over and sat with Caz, I was in the show, too. But now I’m sitting"
"with her, I can see I’m not. I’m not in this made-up story. I never"
"have been. I’m just a viewer, watching it at home, on TV. Just like"
"me and Caz used to watch everything on TV. I hold her hand. She"
"holds it back. We keep on shaking our maracas at the TV with our"
"free hands. I’ve never held Caz’s hand before. Maybe it’s just"
"because we’re so off our tits. Mum should have given us Ecstasy"
"when we were little. We would have got on so much better."
"I don’t know how long we’ve been sitting like this when"
"Courtney comes over, and looks down at us. He’s still holding the"
"very expensive Martin guitar, and strumming on it like he’s Alan-aDale, but in a suede jacket, with receding hair."
"‘Hello ladies,’ he says, superciliously. He’s grinding his teeth"
"quite badly."
"We shake our maracas at him. My pupils are blasted. Caz’s"
"are like saucers."
"‘Hello, Courtney,’ Caz says. She manages to put an admirably"
"vast amount of hatred in every letter of his name, whilst still"
"sounding ostensibly civil."
"‘We were all wondering – could you stop the maracas now?’"
""
"Courtney continues, with exaggerated politeness."
"‘I’m afraid we can’t,’ Caz replies, with equal politeness."
"‘Why?’ Courtney asks. He speaks with icy courtesy."
"There is a pause."
"‘Because you’re a total dick,’ Caz says, as if she is the Queen,"
"greeting the High Commissioner in Zaire at a garden party. She"
"shakes her maraca, by way of punctuation."
"Before I can stop myself, I laugh – a gigantic, unsexy honk,"
"with a definite Wolverhampton accent."
"‘He is!’ I say, joyfully. I am in the throes of revelation. ‘A total"
"dick!’"
"‘A total dick,’ Caz confirms, formally, shaking her maraca."
"‘Christ, you really can’t handle your drugs, can you?’ Courtney"
"says, to me. ‘You’re embarrassing yourself.’"
"‘The thing is,’ I say to Caz, totally ignoring Courtney, ‘is that I"
"can’t even break up with him, because I was never going out with"
"him in the first place. I’ve been imagining the whole thing.’"
"‘A total, imaginary dick,’ Caz says again. We shake our"
"maracas in unison."
"‘Courtney, I’m going to go home and change the locks,’ I say,"
"cheerfully. Still holding hands, me and Caz stand."
"‘We’re going to order a cab now,’ I say, to the room. ‘Thank"
"you for having us, everybody. I’m sorry I short-circuited your mixing"
"desk with champagne. That was an error.’"
"Courtney’s shouting something, but I can’t really hear him. We"
"leave the room at a lick, running as fast as we can now, to get a cab;"
"to get back to London; to find some chewing gum, to stop this"
"interminable teeth-grinding. We’ve just ordered a cab from"
"Reception when I realise I have left one, important thing undone."
"‘Stay there,’ I say to Caz."
"‘Where are you going?’ she yells."
"‘STAY THERE!’ I bellow, running back down the corridor. I"
"burst into the studio. Everyone looks up. Courtney looks at me with"
"a combination of fury, self-pity, and a vast amount of cocaine. But he"
"looks like he will take me back, if I truly apologise. If I really mean it."
"If I love him. If, in my heart, I love him."
"‘Can we keep the maracas?’ I ask."

"I Go Lap-dancing!"
"I have no idea what to wear to a strip club. It’s one of the biggest"
"wardrobe crises of my life."
"‘What are you wearing?’ I ask Vicky, on the phone."
"‘Skirt. Cardigan,’ Vicky says, lighting a fag."
"‘What shoes?’"
"‘Boots. Low heel.’"
"‘Oh, I was going to wear boots, low heel, too,’ I say. ‘We can"
"both wear boots, low heel. That’s good. We’ll be matchy.’"
"Then a bad thought occurs to me. ‘Actually, maybe we"
"shouldn’t both wear boots, low heel,’ I say. ‘If we look too matchy,"
"people might think we’re an act. You know. Like a lesbian act. And"
"try and touch us.’"
"‘No one would believe you’re a lesbian,’ Vicky sighs. ‘You’d"
"make a terrible lesbian.’"
"‘I wouldn’t!’ I say, indignantly. This offends my ‘can do’ nature."
"‘If I wanted, I could be a great lesbian!’"
"‘No you couldn’t,’ Vicky says. ‘You’re offensively hetero-sexual."
"You fancy Father Christmas. By no stretch of the imagination could"
"Father Christmas be construed to have Sapphic androgyny. He"
"wears Wellington boots indoors.’"
"I can’t believe Vicky is doubting my ability to be a lesbian, if I"
"really wanted to be. She’s seen how versatile I can be on a night"
"out. Once, when we went to Bournemouth, we blagged our way"
"backstage of a performance of Run For Your Wife, and convinced"
"Jeffrey Holland – Spike in Hi-de-Hi! – that we were prostitutes, just"
"to see his reaction. He said ‘Blimey!’ in a very edifying manner. My"
"capabilities are endless. She doesn’t know what she’s talking"
"about."
"‘Maybe I’ll wear trainers, instead,’ I say."
"Vicky has asked me if I want to join her for a night out at"
"Spearmint Rhino, on Tottenham Court Road. It’s the year 2000, and"
"strip clubs – for so long regarded as the holding pen for the last few"
"sad, sweaty fucks on earth – have become acceptable again."
"Britpop and Loaded have been all about the rediscovery the"
"British working class’s monochrome tropes – pubs, greyhound"
"racing, anoraks, football in the park, bacon sandwiches, ‘birds’ –"
"and strip clubs come under this heading. ‘Ladettes’ now enjoy a"
"night out in the classier strip clubs of the metropolis. Various Spice"
"Girls have been pictured in strip clubs, smoking cigars and"
"cheering the acts on. Zoe Ball and Sara Cox attended strip-club hen"
"nights. Titty-bars are being marketed as an exciting, marginally"
"loucher version of the Groucho Club – just somewhere for anyone"
"who liked to start a night out at 1am."
"Partly out of journalistic hunger to cover the phenomenon, and"
"partly because newspaper editors are invariably excited by pictures"
"of female hacks in a strip club, the Evening Standard have asked"
"Vicky to go spend an evening in ‘The Rhino’, in order to see what all"
"the fuss is about."
"‘It’s against every single one of my feminist principles. These"
"are arenas of abuse,’ I said, when she called."
""
"‘The manager is giving us complimentary champagne all"
"night,’ Vicky said."
"‘I will meet you there at 9pm,’ I said, with all the dignity I could"
"muster."
"From the pavement outside, the club has an odd air. Looking"
"through the doors, the place is covered in ornate gold mouldings,"
"red walls and twinkling lights; it’s overdone, ersatz glamour looking"
"like some kind of putative Titty Disneyland. As we hesitate on the"
"wrong side of the rope banner, a couple of punters roll up, and are"
"ushered inside by the bouncers."
"I am amazed at how confident and untroubled they seem –"
"not guilty at all. I would have presumed you would make some"
"excuse for visiting a strip club – saying loudly, to the bouncers, ‘I am"
"doing a collection, on behalf of the sick children,’ or, ‘Council. I’ve"
"come to check your electrics,’ or, in a fake Mexican accent, ‘This Pret"
"A Manger, yes?’"
"Instead, they walk in – slightly sweaty suits, slightly hawkish"
"eyes – as if it’s perfectly normal to leave the office, then relax by"
"paying very young women to reveal their labia. What a lovely social"
"circle I have, I reflect, not for the first time. All of my male friends"
"would be genuinely horrified to go to a strip club. They all wear"
"cardigans, collect vinyl, and fetishise loose-leaf tea. They would"
"never want to pay to see a stranger’s labia. Indeed, my boyfriend"
"still says, ‘Thank you, that was very nice,’ after he’s seen my labia,"
"and we’ve been together for four years."
"‘This is like an AGM for Bad Husband Material,’ I say to Vicky,"
"as we go in. ‘Everyone here has left a trail of sad girlfriends and"
"wives.’"
"Still, the free champagne is very free, and we have a table,"
"right down the front, by the catwalk – or ‘twat walk’, as Vicky"
"renames it. For the first hour, we treat Spearmint Rhino like a pub,"
"albeit one with the occasional distraction of some tits floating over"
"our heads. One particularly enjoyable conversation about the"
"imminent purchase of a new winter coat is interrupted by some"
"buttocks suddenly arriving in our eye line but, to be fair, I’ve had this"
"happen to me in a Wetherspoons before. After two hours, some of"
"the ‘girls’ come over to chat, and, as is the way of all gatherings of"
"women, we all start gossiping: Vicky in her cardi, me in my jacket,"
"the girls in diamante bras and itchy-looking thongs."
"By 1am, we’re pretty tipsy, have been given a private dance"
"that has left us both quite discombobulated – this chick has an arse"
"like heaven – and we’ve been regaled with an amazing story about"
"a very famous TV presenter and habitué of the club, which ends with"
"the line, ‘So his wife found out he had herpes – on Christmas Day!’"
"We are in our booth rofling away, thinking, ‘This is just like the"
"Groucho, but with real twats, instead of metaphorical ones. This is"
"actually OK.’"
"The PR comes over to us."
"‘I’m off home,’ she says, pulling on her coat. ‘You ladies are"
"welcome to stay, if you want.’"
"I look down the neck of the champagne bottle. There’s still a"
"good two glasses left."
"‘We’ll stay!’ I say, brightly. ‘My personal motto is: never walk"
"away from a loaded bottle.’"
""
"The PR leaves us to carry on our evening unchaperoned."
"Cheerfully topping up our glasses, I’m just about to launch into a"
"lengthy anecdote about the one time I offered to strip for a lover –"
"sadly ruining the mood by accidentally treading in a bowl of porridge"
"I’d left by the bed that morning – when two bouncers approach our"
"table."
"‘Evening, constables,’ I say, merrily."
"‘It’s time for you to go, ladies,’ they say, looking very stern and"
"unyielding."
"‘I assure you, I have only had a few weak ales,’ I said, slightly"
"cross-eyed. ‘I’m perferly fine to remain here.’"
"‘Time to go,’ the bouncer said, pulling my chair back from the"
"table. His buddy does the same to Vicky. We are hustled out in less"
"than a minute, in a flurry of coat-grabbing and indignation."
"On the pavement, we are outraged."
"‘Why? Why are we being thrown out?’ we screech. ‘We’re"
"simply taking a wry, sideways look at stripping! We’re"
"COLUMNISTS! We’re QUALIFIED for this! We’re BONA FIDE! We’ve"
"BEEN ON RADIO FOUR!’"
"‘We know your game,’ they said. ‘You’re prostitutes.’"
"Apparently, we find out – during the next five minutes of"
"increasingly shrill inquiry – ‘rough-looking’ Russian prostitutes"
"often frequent the club, picking up trade from clients whose taste is"
"for disappointingly ‘normal’-looking women rather than the"
"strippers. This is what the bouncer is convinced we are. He knows"
"we aren’t strippers – so we must, then, ergo, be prostitutes. Vicky, in"
"her cardigan, and me, in my trainers."
"In his world, woman-type runs on a binary system: stripper,"
"whore. There aren’t any other kind of women. Certainly not 20something columnists hoping to milk 1,200-words out of the event,"
"whilst caning the free bar for all it was worth."
"Once again, I was apt to dwell on what a thunderingly"
"inappropriate and rude relic the strip club is."
"‘I TOLD you they were arenas of abuse,’ I said to Vicky, as we"
"sat in a doorway, smoking a fag."
"‘But we’ll both be able to get a column out of it,’ she replied,"
"eminently reasonably."
"And so, really, we were not losers at all."
"But, of course, in a wider sense, we were. For – given the"
"context of the entirety of history up until about yesterday – the idea of"
"clubs where women take off their clothes in front of men is"
"stupendously … impolite."
"After all, history is very much ‘99 per cent women being"
"subjugated, disenfranchised and sexually objectified’. Women have"
"– there’s no two ways about this – really been shafted by the simple"
"fact that men fancy them. We can see that men’s desire for women"
"has, throughout history, given rise to unspeakable barbarity. It’s"
"caused terrible, terrible things to happen, because men have been"
"the dominant force, with no rules or checks on their behaviour. It’s"
"no exaggeration to refer to ‘sexual tyranny’, and ‘total bullshit’. Within"
"living memory in this country, men could rape their wives: women"
"were not seen as a separate sexual entity, with a right of refusal."
"Germany only criminalised the practice in 1997; Haiti, in 2006. It’s"
"still legal in – amongst other places – Pakistan, Kenya and the"
"Bahamas. Even in countries where it has been criminalised, there"
"is an unwillingness to actually prosecute: Japan and Poland have"

"been particularly criticised by human rights organisations for their"
"low conviction rates. There are large parts of the world where"
"women are – with either the explicit or non-explicit sanction of the"
"state – deemed little more than souped-up sex toys for men."
"In this context, then, it’s obvious that a lap-dancing club is as"
"incongruous in a modern society as a ‘Minstrel Show!’ or adverts for"
"‘Jew Beating – Sticks £1!’"
"Of course, the big difference here is that if a white man"
"suggested starting a cleaning agency that only employed black"
"cleaners, dressed up in plantation clothing, and being excessively"
"cowed and deferential to their employers, the entire world would be"
"up in arms."
"‘What are you playing at?’ they would shout. ‘We’re not going"
"to bring back a “light entertainment” version of slavery! Not even if"
"it’s for a “social experiment” reality documentary on Channel 4!’"
"But what are strip clubs, and lap-dancing clubs, if not ‘light"
"entertainment’ versions of the entire history of misogyny?"
"Any argument in their favour is fallacious. Recently, it has"
"behoved modish magazines to print interviews with young women,"
"who explain that their career as strippers is paying their way through"
"university. This is thought to pretty much end any objections against"
"strip clubs, on the basis that, look!, clever girls are doing it – in"
"order to become middle-class professionals with degrees! Ipso"
"facto Girl Power!"
"For myself, I can’t believe that girls saying ‘Actually, I’m paying"
"my university fees by stripping’ is seen as some kind of righteous,"
"empowered, end-of-argument statement on the ultimate morality of"
"these places. If women are having to strip to get an education – in a"
"way that male teenage students are really notably not – then that’s a"
"gigantic political issue, not a reason to keep strip clubs going."
"Are we really saying that strip clubs are just wonderful"
"charities that allow women – well, the pretty, thin ones, anyway:"
"presumably the fatter, plainer ones have to do whatever it is all the"
"male students are also doing – to get degrees? I can’t believe"
"women supposedly in further education are that stupid."
"One doesn’t want to be as blunt as to say, ‘Girls, get the fuck"
"off the podium – you’re letting us all down,’ but: Girls, get the fuck off"
"the podium – you’re letting us all down."
"But you know what? It’s not just a question of girls letting other girls"
"down. Strip clubs let everyone down. Men and women approach"
"their very worst here. There’s no self-expression or joy in these"
"joints – no springboard to self-discovery, or adventure, like any"
"decent night out involving men, women, alcohol, and taking your"
"clothes off. Why do so many people have a gut reaction against strip"
"clubs? Because, inside them, no one’s having fun."
"Instead, people are expressing needs (to earn money, to see"
"a woman’s skin) in pretty much the most depressing way possible."
"Sit in one of these places sober – as Vicky and I did initially; it took"
"almost SEVEN MINUTES for the first bottle of complimentary"
"champagne to get to the table – and you see what’s going on here."
"The women hate the men. The stripper’s internal monologue as"

"cab fare home. You spend this money on nothing at all – addiction"
"to porn and strip clubs are the third biggest cause of debt in men."
"Between 60 and 80 per cent of strippers come from a background"

"But, of course, they are not. The difference between a"
"burlesque artist putting on a single show, in front of hundreds, and"
"a stripper on an eight-hour shift, going one on one, is immense: the"
"polarity between being a minstrel for a bored monarch, playing"
"whatever song the monarch asks for, and U2 playing Wembley"

"With burlesque, not only does the power balance rest with the"
"person taking their clothes off – as it always should do, in polite"

"self-expression: it has a campy, tranny, fetish element to it. It’s not –"
"to use the technical term – ‘an easy wank’."
"Additionally, despite its intense stylisation of sexuality, it"
"doesn’t have the oddly aggressive, humourless air of the strip club:"
"burlesque artists sing, talk and laugh. They tell jokes – something"
"unthinkable in the inexplicably po-faced atmosphere of a lapdancing club, which treats male/female interactions with all the"
"gravitas of Cold War-era meetings between Russia and the USA,"
"rather than a potential hoot. Perhaps as a direct consequence,"
"burlesque artists treat their own sexuality as something fabulous"
"and enjoyable – rather than something bordering on a weapon, to"
"be ground, unsmilingly, into the face of the sweaty idiot punter"
"below."
"Because, most importantly, burlesque clubs feel like a place"
"for girls. Strip clubs – despite the occasional presence of a Spice"
"Girl, ten years ago – do not. Watching good burlesque in action, you"

"values system of a woman: beautiful lighting, glossy hair, absurd"
"(giant cocktail glasses; huge feather fans) accessories, velvet"
"corsets, fashionable shoes, Ava Gardner eyeliner, pale skin, classy"
"manicures, humour, and a huge round of applause at the end –"
"instead of an uncomfortable, half-hidden erection, and silence."
"Burlesque artists have names – Dita Von Teese, Gypsy Rose"

"She’s wearing a cream chiffon dress and cream satin shoes,"
"both of which are covered in mud. She has nettle stings up her legs,"

"she could have a small, portable city-wall – lined with archers – she"
"would."
"‘What happened when the tent broke?’ I ask, pointing at the"
"rucksack. The rucksack is very, very wet."
"‘A stoned fuckwit in the next tent tried to mend the poles with"
"three pencils and some Sellotape,’ she replies. ‘Even though I kept"
"telling him it wouldn’t work, because modern tent poles have to"
"bend. Then we had to walk to the wedding, which wasn’t in an"
"adjacent field at all but seven fields away. My shoes didn’t like the"
"seven fields. They didn’t like that at all. Neither did my legs, when"
"we found the nettles. In a lane, a tractor came near us, and we had"
"to lean into a hedge. All of me hated that. Also, the tractor made me"
"nervous, so I did a sweat in my dress.’"
"She lifts up her arms, to display the stains."
"‘But we had some luck! Because then it started raining quite"
"heavily on me, which made the frizziness of my hair, rather than the"
"sweatiness of my armpits, the go-to visual starting point for the"
"entire congregation when we got there. Five minutes into the"
"ceremony.’"
"Caz is now pouring her cystitis medicine into a mug, along"
""
"with three shots of vodka. Her story didn’t get any better from here."
"Apparently, everyone had got so blindingly drunk that by 3pm, even"
"50-something aunties were leaning against the buffet table, saying,"
"‘I’ve got to sober up.’ It being a very ‘close-knit’ country family, Caz"
"was repeatedly questioned by guests as to who she ‘knew’ – ‘Kind"
"of inferring that I’d walked into the middle of fucking nowhere in the"
"rain in order to steal a portion of very mediocre ham salad.’ By 4pm,"
"Caz was so furiously, despairingly bored that she went and sat on"
"the toilet for an hour."
"‘They were very posh Portaloos. Apparently they’re the ones"
"they use at Glyndebourne,’ she said. ‘They had music pumped into"
"them. I listened to “Under Pressure” by Queen five times. Then I did"
"what Freddie would have done – walked in the pissing rain up a hill"
"until I got reception, called a minicab, and booked myself in the"
"Marriott, Exeter. Don’t ask me if I’ve got cystitis. I’ve got cystitis.’"
"She popped three Nurofen Plus, and burst into tears. ‘Five"
"weddings in four years,’ she wailed, taking the muddy shoes off,"
"and throwing them in the sink. ‘I genuinely hope no one else I know"
"ever, ever falls in love again. People discovering true love works out"
"badly for me.’"
"Of course, people discovering true love works out badly for"
"everyone, really. I mean, it’s OK in the end – once everyone settles"
"down, and stops making a big fuss about it. But fairly near the"
"beginning, there is a massive test of everyone’s patience and love –"
"a wedding."
"For whilst there are plenty of awful things we can place at the"
"door of men – wars, rape, nuclear weapons, stock market crashes,"
"Top Gear, that thing where you put your hand down the front of your"
"jogging bottoms and rearrange your sweaty knackers whilst on the"
"bus, then touching a railing I now have to touch, too, all covered in"
"your sweaty bollock-mist – weddings definitely come down to the"
"ladies."
"Weddings are our fault, ladies. Every aspect of their"
"pantechnicon of awfulness happened on our watch. And you know"
"what? Not only have we let humanity down, but we’ve let ourselves"
"down, too."
"Weddings do women no good at all. They’re a viper’s pit of"
"waste and despair. And nearly every aspect of them reverberates"
"badly against the very people who love them the most: us. Our love"
"for a wedding is a bad love. It does us no good. It will end badly,"
"leaving us feeling cheated, and alone."
"Whenever I think about weddings, I want to run into the church"
"– like Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate – and shout ‘STOP! STOP"
"THE WEDDINGS!’"
"And when the organ has ground to a halt, and everyone turns"
"around, astonished, to stare at me, and the vicar has stopped"
"stuttering ‘Well, really!’ in a disapproving manner, I’m going to rock"
"up to the pulpit – tearing my stupid bloody fascinator off as I go –"
"light a fag, lean back, and this is the sermon I will preach."
"1) COST. Ladies! Being a woman is already very, very expensive."
"Tampons, hairdressers, childcare, beauty aids, women’s shoes"
"being three times more costly than men’s – the combination of the"
""
"things we need (Lil-lets) combined with the things we feel naked"
"without (proper haircut) is already ruinous. And that’s before we"
"factor in both women earning 30 per cent less than men and being"
"the ones who usually have to watch their career go all Titanic when"
"the question of ‘Who will look after the kids?’ raises its head."
"In the old days, the question of a dowry would often be one of"
"the deciding factors of a woman’s life: how much money her"
"parents could settle on a marriage dictating whom a woman could"
"and couldn’t marry."
"These days, of course, a woman is free to marry whomsoever"
"she chooses. And yet, marriage still often involves crippling sums of"
"money – the average cost of a UK wedding is £21,000 – but now"
"commonly paid for by the couple themselves, in some kind of"
"bizarre, voluntary, ultimately useless but self-imposed dowry."
"Spending £21,000 at a stage in your life when you are – usually –"
"still pretty poor, and trying to buy things like ‘a house’ and ‘things to"
"eat’ seems pretty baffling, whichever way you slice it – not least"
"when one in four marriages ends in divorce."
"If we were inventing things from scratch, surely we would"
"decide to throw a gigantic £21,000 celebration of love right at the"
"end of the whole thing – when we’re in our sixties and seventies,"
"the mortgage is paid off, and we can see if the whole ‘I love you"
"forever’ thing actually worked out or not."
"£21,000! Oh, it makes me cry. Personally, I wouldn’t spend"
"£21,000 on anything that didn’t have either a) doors and windows or"
"b) the ability to grant me three wishes. £21,000 is an absurd"
"amount of money to spend on something. It is a figure that denotes"
"insanity."
"The money thing is a key issue here – because of what it is"
"spent on. Aside from getting together the deposit for a house, the"
"average couple will probably never again spend that amount of"
"money on a single thing in their lives. And what is it that that"
"£21,000 buys? Very little that lasts. There are the overpriced"
"photographs in the insanely expensive album, and all the presents,"
"of course – but spending £21,000 to get £2,000’s worth of"
"kitchenware from John Lewis is poor economics, whichever way"
"you slice it. The dress is never worn again, you never get round to"
"‘dying the shoes red, and wearing them to a party!’, no matter how"
"often you convince yourself you might, and as for the rings – well, I"
"can hardly be the only married woman on her fifth wedding band,"
"after losing various others in swimming pools, down cracks in"
"worktops and, once, in a loaf of bread (it’s a long story)."
"What the £21,000 buys you is Aspect Two of why weddings"
"are so bad for women:"
"2) THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. ‘It’s the best day of your life.’ Well."
"The snags here are obvious. Of course it’s not the best day of your"
"life. A day that was really the best day of your life wouldn’t involve"
"Uncle Wrong, Aunt Drip, and someone from your office you had to"
"invite, lest you spend the next six years being sulked at every time"
"you pass them in a stairwell."
"Clearly – with these enforced parameters – your wedding is"
"actually like some unholy melange of some works away-day and"
"family therapy, and should, therefore, be regarded with the same"
"mixture of quiet stoicism, grim determination and heavy drinking."
""
"Also, bear this in mind, ladies – the phrasing: ‘the best day of"
"your life’. Yes, the best day of your life: the bride. Not anyone else’s."
"Let’s face it – from time immemorial, the groom has quietly not"
"given a shit about the event, from beginning to end. If you want to"
"plunge a grown man into a combination of deep despair and barely"
"repressed panic, simply talk to him, for a minute or more, about"
"table arrangements, boutonnières, flower girls’ shoes, marquees,"
"the hiring of a castle, what Madonna did for her wedding, and"
"whether or not you should have a colonic a week before, to look"
"‘fresh-faced’."
"Weddings are essentially something that brides invite"
"grooms along to as an afterthought – and a thought that came after"
"working out which trios of chocolate puddings were going to be"
"served, at that. Women start planning their weddings when they’re"
"five, for goodness’ sake. When they have no idea who they’re"
"marrying, and just imagine an Action Man’s body with a convenient"
"pixellation where his face is. By way of comparison, at the same"
"age, the only future event boys are planning is how they might be"
"able to score the winning goal in the World Cup whilst, at the same"
"time, playing the guitar solo to ‘November Rain’ by Guns N’ Roses."
"So it’s clearly not the best day of the groom’s life. And it’s also"
"not the best day of any of the guests’ lives, either. Because"
"weddings aren’t fun for the guests. It’s something we’re wholly"
"aware of when we’re guests – 300 miles from home, in a"
"pashmina, making awkward chitty-chat with a bleary drunkard on"
"the table clearly referred to as ‘The Dregs’ in the placement plans –"
"but forget the minute we start planning our own weddings."
"‘I can’t believe Carrie dragged us all to the sodding Isle of"
"Skye for her wedding,’ we moan, staring at our overdrafts. ‘Three"
"bloody days in a four-star hotel. She’d better not divorce him."
"Indeed, I feel inclined to sew them together, so they cannot stray –"
"like the Human Caterpillar.’"
"‘Where do you want to get married, then?’ someone may ask."
"‘Singapore!’ you cry, enthusiastically. ‘We’re inviting everyone over"
"for a week! On day three, there’s a boat trip to a deserted island –"
"only £75 extra for each person! It’s going to be AMAZING!’"
"*"
"I did it myself. Up until my actual wedding, I’d done everything"
"brilliantly. I had so not been a twat about being in love. I wasn’t overdramatic or attention-seeking. I had recovered from breaking up"
"with Courtney by the simple expediency of making a cheerful badge"
"that read ‘I Went Out With Satan – And Survived!’ and wearing it to all"
"social engagements – thus answering any and all questions about"
"the status of our relationship, just by pointing at it."
"I didn’t mope, and I didn’t sulk – instead, I made up for a year"
"of ill-rewarded fidelity by cheerfully going back out into the world,"
"and seeing if there was any fun left out there for me. As it turned out,"
"there was loads. Every night was like a sexy trolley-dash – racing"
"around London, being all twinkly-eyed with anyone amusing, up"
"against the clock of the last bus home. One evening with a pop star"
"ended with his manager having to remove him, naked, from my"
"hotel bedroom at 3am."
"A week later, and a teenage boy literally turned up on my"

"doorstep – who knew they did deliveries these days? – and was so"
"unexpectedly tender and joyful, he undid half of Courtney’s evil over"
"one, sunny winter afternoon, and night of exclaiming wonder."
"In both instances, I was gratified to note that getting back out"
"‘on the dating scene’ required – contrary to everything I’d ever been"
"given to understand on the subject – absolutely no effort or"
"insecurity at all. There was no ‘post-break-up make-over’ for me. I’d"
"put on a stone, and cut a bad fringe; but I was so happy, no one"
"appeared to notice it. With the eventually-unconscious pop star, I"
"simply asked the question, ‘Shall we have a shag?’ With the"
"teenage boy, meanwhile, I made my move whilst in the deathlessly"
"hot outfit of a burgundy-coloured BHS towelling robe, £19.99."
"For a month, I rode some kind of relaxed sex galleon around"
"London, like a lady pirate – remembering, again, how every"
"conversation with a member of the opposite sex carries with it that"
"tiny, atom-small, atomic-bright possibility: ‘Hello. Are you “it”?’"
"And every Thursday, I would invite over Pete from Melody"
"Maker, cook him soup, and tell him all these stories – ‘So I rang"
"down to Room Service, and asked for a steak sandwich, and a pair"
"of men’s pants’ – while we played records, and cried laughing."
"Then, in the middle of February, my mood, suddenly,"
"changed."
"I woke one Monday morning to find an odd, albatrossunhappiness had descended. It wasn’t depression, or misery – it"
"was both more restless, and more hopeful, than that. I felt"
"suspended: a combination of waiting for something, and missing"
"something terribly – even though I’d never had it."
"Indeed, not only had I never had it – I also had no idea what it"
"was. The source of my blues absolutely baffled me. I spent a week"
"wandering around my flat, deflated – clueless as to what it meant."
"I’d pick something up – my phone, a record, a fag – and then put"
"them down again, sadly, going, ‘No, that’s not it.’"
"Twice I went to the shops to buy food and, halfway around the"
"supermarket, I’d think, ‘When I get back, it might have happened!’ I’d"
"bustle back, full of energy and hope again, and burst into the flat –"
"only to find it exactly as I’d left it. Whatever it was still hadn’t arrived."
"The disappointment was crushing."
"After a week of this, on the Sunday night, my subconscious –"
"as if exasperated at my dimness – finally spelt it out for me. I went to"
"bed drunk, and dreamed I was on the escalators at Baker Street"
"underground station, going up. The escalators seemed impossibly"
"high. I couldn’t even see the top. It was going to be a long, long time"
"before I got to the turnstiles."
"‘It’s going to take forever to get up there!’ I exclaimed."
"‘It’s OK,’ a voice said. I turned around, and saw Pete, standing"
"behind me. ‘I’m here,’ he said, simply."
"‘Oh!’ I said, waking up."
"‘Oh!’"
"‘I’m in love! I’m in love with Pete.’"
"I looked around the flat."
"‘He’s what’s not here.’"
"Six years and a £19.99 engagement ring later, and it’s our wedding"
"day. It was – initially – going to be in a registry office, in London,"
"followed by a reception at a pub. In boring, empty mid-October."
""
"Everyone could have got the bus home. It would have cost less than"
"200 quid. We could have knocked it all off in five hours flat. Oh, I"
"wish we’d had that wedding."
"After I’d inhaled 600 bridal magazines and taken into account"
"a few requests from the in-laws, however, it ended up being in a"
"former monastery in Coventry, two days after Christmas."
"Coincidentally, also Caz’s birthday. She has always borne the brunt"
"of the love of others."
"I don’t want to exaggerate but, by God, it was a bad wedding."
"Here I am, at 24, waiting to come down the aisle in my red"
"velvet dress, with ivy in my hair. I look like Lady Bacchus, except for"
"my feet. My lifelong curse of not being able to find shoes I can walk"
"in extends even here, on my most glamorous day – under the satinedged velvet, I’m wearing a manky pair of Doc Marten sandals."
"My father is in a suit he shoplifted from Ciro Citterio, and"
"some shoes he shoplifted from Burtons – but he looks calm, wise"
"and not a little emotional about giving away his first child in"
"marriage."
"‘Oh, my lovely daughter,’ he says, smelling a little of whisky."
"‘My kitten-cat.’ His eyes have the faint shine of tears in them. As the"
"music strikes up in the next room – the slow, village march of The"
"Lilac Time’s ‘Spin A Cavalu’ – he takes my arm, and leans in to"
"whisper something. This is where he tells me something of how he"
"and Mum have stayed together for 24 years, and had eight kids, I"
"think to myself. This is going to be one of our great bonding"
"moments. Oh Lord, I hope he doesn’t make me cry. I have so much"
"eyeliner on."
"‘Darling girl,’ he says, as the usher opens the door, and I see"
"the whole congregation crane around, to watch my entrance."
"‘Darling love. Remember you’re a Womble.’"
"I walk down the aisle so fast that, halfway down, I realise I’m"
"going to get there way before the music finishes. I also note that I"
"am beaming, rather smugly – and I worry how the registrar will take"
"this."
"She will think I’m not serious about this! I panic. She’ll"
"REFUSE to marry me, on the grounds I’m SUPERCILIOUS!"
"I immediately slow down to a funereal pace, and assume a"
"look of burdened worry. Later, my sisters tell me they were"
"convinced that I’d just got the first twinge of cystitis, and that they’d"
"all automatically reached into their handbags for a bottle of"
"potassium citrate, which we all carry around with us."
"Still, I look fine compared to my husband-to-be. He’s so"
"nervous he’s a very pale green, and is shaking like a sock on a"
"washing line."
"‘I’ve never seen a more anxious groom,’ the registrar"
"confides, later. ‘I had to give him two shots of whisky.’"
"I can’t remember anything about the ceremony. I spent the"
"whole thing going, ‘REMEMBER you’re a WOMBLE?’ in my head, in"
"outrage."
"An hour later, and everyone’s in the bar. Many of our invited guests"
"haven’t been able to make it, because it’s two days after Christmas,"

"In order to ‘find’ her, my brother Eddie tries to steal a golf"
"buggy, so he can drive around looking for her. Two other siblings"
"have to stand in front of him, saying ‘NO!’"

"insistence that he be the DJ results in our First Dance being,"

"‘My father doesn’t want a Tic-Tac, thanks,’ Pete says, firmly"
"escorting Dave out of the room."
"By 10pm, most people have gone to bed early – trying to"
"salvage some aspect of being dragged to an expensive hotel in the"
"middle of their holidays. I like to think they are all eating sausage"
"rolls, stolen from the buffet, and watching Cheers. I am happy for"

"watching Ghostbusters for the 50th time. In that respect at least, I"
"was sane. Because problem Number Three with the modern"
"wedding is The Hen Night."
"3) HEN NIGHTS. What was, 20 years ago, simply a night in the pub,"
"but with extra-raucous screaming – sum expenditure: £30 on"
"Baileys – now involves a huge swathe of time and money from"
"those unfortunate and loyal enough to be bridesmaids."
"Caz has borne the bad end of 21st-century hen nights. For"
"despite being the world’s most reluctant wedding guest, capricious,"
"Beadle-like gods have made her be Chief Bridesmaid no less than"

"later that that could have happened to anyone."
"4) ‘EVERYONE I LOVE IS HERE.’ Do you really want ‘all the people"

"thought a man of his age would be capable of – and gently prised"
"the bottle from my hand. He stared at it – now empty – for a"
"moment."
"‘Ah,’ he said, regretfully. ‘The ’93 Alsace Grand Cru.’"
"There was a long pause."
"‘Still,’ he said, with enormous grace, touching the bottle with"

"people you make miserable by evacuating them out onto a freezing"
"lawn in Coventry two days after Christmas, putting them in a fairyring sing-song, or making them suicidal in a bad jacket? It’s your"
"big day, after all! The bride! You deserve to have a single day where"
"it’s all about YOU! THIS IS YOUR BIG DAY! IT’S THE BEST DAY OF"

"romantic mini-breaks, first shags and birthdays should tell us this."
"Aside from getting my mother tanked on White Russians, the"
"quickest and easiest way to kill the fun good-times is to put a"
"massive pressure of expectation on it in advance. Really, anything a"
"woman is assured should be ‘the best day of your life’ should be"
"run from a mile. It rarely works out well. Recall that another day"
"which is often touted as ‘the best of your life’ is when you give birth"
"to your children. I hardly need remind you of how likely that is to end"
"with you calling out to a Godless heaven for as much morphine as"
"your body can handle without you actually having a cardiac arrest."
"And secondly, I don’t think this demented wedding lust does"
"our collective image any good. It makes us look like our frame of"
"reference for fun is very small. I feel a little like Del Boy falling"

"And yet, women now think of it as our ‘reward’ to spend one"
"incredibly expensive day acting like these twats, before biting the"
"bullet, settling down and never having another ‘special’ day again."
"Of course, a great deal of not having any more special days, ever"
"again, comes down to the fact you’ve just spunked £21,000 on"
"16,000 vol-au-vents and a ‘light jazz’ band – but the symbolism of it"
"all is unbearably potent."
"With stuff like this, you have to look at the men. Do they have"
"one, special day where they feel like kings of the world – and then"
"go back to lives of quiet drudgery? No. They go off and please"
"themselves constantly: as Germaine Greer pointed out in The"
"Whole Woman, they fill their spare time with pleasingly nonproductive activities like fishing, golf, listening to records, playing on"
"the Xbox and pretending to be goblins in World of Warcraft. They"
"don’t have this insane, pent-up need to spend one day pretending"
"to be Princess Diana (in the fun years, obviously. Not the throwingyourself-down-the-stairs bit. Or the bit where Camilla came in and"
"ruined everything)."
"Women, meanwhile, spend their spare time taking on the"
"never-ending list of self-improvements, or domestic tasks:"
"housework, homework, counselling the troubled, worming the cat,"
"doing pelvic floor exercises, trying to be inventive with cabbage, and"
"exfoliating ingrowing hairs – somehow mollified by having that one"
"‘best day of their lives’."
"Surely, women, we would happily exchange one ‘special’ day"
"for a life filled with more modest pleasures?"
"Or perhaps we should just junk the whole idea of getting"
"married in the first place. I’m generally against anything where"
"you’re supposed to change your name. When else do you get"
"named something else? On joining a nunnery, or becoming a porn"
"star. As an ostensibly joyful celebration of love, that’s bad company"
"to be in."

"CHAPTER 11"
""
"I Get Into Fashion!"
"‘I bought a dress today!’ I say, as my husband walks through the"
"door. ‘A NEW DRESS! NEW DRESS NEW DRESS NEW DRESS!’"
"It is a brown, cheesecloth, peasant-y dress – ‘TWELVE"
"POUNDS, Pete – TWELVE POUNDS!’– which I bought from the"
"market – ‘IT’S FROM THE MARKET, LOVE!’ – on Seven Sisters"
"Road earlier that day. The purchase has excited me hugely – it is"
"the first new item of clothing I’ve bought for nearly two years."
"At the age of 24, I am still not really used to buying clothes."
"Not only are the clothes I covet at the time – crinolines, tippets,"
"bonnets, red flannel petticoats, button-up black patent booties,"
"damask ballgowns, shagreen gloves, fox-fur muffs and calico"
"nightdresses – not that readily available on Holloway Road – but I"
"have also been stony-ass broke for some time."
"Although I had been earning a decent wage as a journalist, it"
"turns out I had made another one of the big miscalculations of my"
"life: believing that Income Tax is, like menstruation, optional. I"
"haven’t paid a penny of tax for the first four years of my working life."
"‘I thought they’d ring you up if they wanted it!’ I wail, to the"
"accountant I’d just hired. ‘Or that they’d send you a letter, saying"
"“Guess what – it’s Tax O’Clock!” or something. But they never said"
"anything. The Inland Revenue have not been chatty.’"
"My accountant went on to explain how the burden of"
"disclosure rests with the individual, rather than the Revenue, and"
"that I would need to supply all my bank statements, wage slips and"
"expense claims since 1994 – but I wasn’t really listening."
"In part, this was because I know a great many of my bank"
"statements, wage slips and expense claims got left in a skip in"
"Camden in 1996, along with an armchair I now regretted, in"
"retrospect, discarding – but it’s also because I was calculating just"
"how poor I was going to be for the foreseeable future."
"Even with my shonky maths, I estimated that I was going to"
"have to put every penny of my income into paying off my back-tax for"
"at least two years, and that I would have to beg Pete to support me"
"financially in exchange for bread-and-butter pudding, jokes and sex."
"‘Yesthat’sfine,’ Pete said, moving me into his house, giving"
"me his spare front-door key. ‘Thatsoundsabsolutelyfine.’"
"For the next 24 months, I am as poor as a church mouse, but I"
"do get a lot of opportunity to work on my stand-up routines."
"Two years later, and I’m still going on about the dress. I’m twirling"
"around in it like Scarlett O’Hara in her ballgown."
"‘ I t was only 12 pounds!’ I say, guiltily. ‘Twelve pounds!"
"Although it felt lovely to buy something new, I won’t need another"
"dress for years now! I can dress it up and dress it down with"
"accessories! It really will be value for money. That’s my celebratory"
"spending-spree finished.’"
"‘You know,’ Pete says, polishing off his 914th bread-andbutter pudding, ‘all other women buy a lot more clothes than you. A"
"lot. Every lunchtime, all the women in my office come back with"
""
"something new in a bag. Now you’ve paid off that tax, I think you"
"could buy more clothes, to be honest. If you want. I mean, I don’t"
"care what you wear. You can wear nothing at all if you want. Can I"
"have some more bread-and-butter pudding, please?’"
"The next day, while Pete’s at work, I think about what he said. All the"
"other women buy lots more clothes, I think. They have lots more"
"clothes than me. They are doing things differently. I’m not doing"
"what the women do."
"I go upstairs to the bedroom, and look in my wardrobe. Here"
"is the sum total of my clothing, at the age of 24: a black velvet floorlength goth dress, which I bought when I was 17, and now has pileless, bald patches on the elbow, from ‘wear’. Two pairs of trousers"
"– one black, one navy. A free promotional T-shirt by the band Salad,"
"which has the word ‘Salad’ on it, which I like to wear whilst"
"preparing, or eating, sausages. A green chenille cardigan from"
"Marks & Spencer, which is so nice I’ve twice had to steal it back off"
"my sister Col when she comes for a visit. A Victorian-style nightie,"
"which I often style out as daywear. And my swimming costume."
"I’m not being a proper woman, I think, staring at my wardrobe."
"All the other women are ‘putting together outfits’ and ‘working on"
"their looks’. I am just ‘putting together the cleanest things’. Now I’ve"
"got some money again, I should sort this out."
"It seems that being a woman is very expensive and timeconsuming. My innocence about this is incongruous, given my age,"
"but total. I come from grunge, and then Britpop – scenes where you"
"boast about how little you spent on an outfit (‘Three quid! From a"
"jumble sale!’ ‘Ooooh, pricey – I found this jacket in a skip. On a"
"dead man. Under a fox carcass’) and taking pride in ‘getting ready to"
"go out’ consists of little more than washing your face, putting on"
"your Doc Martens/trainers, and applying black Barry M nail varnish,"
"£1, on the bus into town."
"But now it seems you find ‘the dress’ – but then ‘the dress’"
"must have ‘the belt’, and a complementary but not overly matching"
"bag must be found, which works with not only the correct hosiery but"
"also something to ‘throw over’, if you become chilly. It’s like fucking"
"Dragon’s Quest – an endless list of things you’ve got to run around"
"and try and find; possibly in a cave, or under a sage. The thing you"
"‘throw over’ can’t be an anorak, or a picnic rug, salvaged from under"
"the stairs, by the way, but a deconstructed cardigan, hacking-style"
"jacket, £200 pashmina, or a ‘shrug’, which unfamiliar item seems,"
"to my untrained eyes, to be a shrunken cardigan made by a fool. It"
"all looks bloody knackering. It’s going to cut into my bread-andbutter-pudding-making time severely."
"All of this comes to a head in shoes – specifically, heels. I’ve"
"spent my whole life in trainers, or boots, but it’s very clear that, if I"
"am to properly make a go of my twenties, I will just have to go out"
"and get some heels. The women’s magazines I read are all"
"unequivocal about heels: they are a non-negotiable part of being a"
"woman, along with the potential to lactate, and the XX chromosome."
"Women are supposed to adore heels more than they adore their"
"own bodies, or thoughts. They’re also supposed to have a great"
"many more shoes than body, or thoughts. Unlike your arse, or"
"thoughts of revolution, you just can’t have too many shoes!!!!!!!!!!!"
"‘No one messes with a woman in heels,’ one feature in Elle"
""
"concludes. ‘They are your greatest weapons in the style wars.’ This"
"shit sounds serious."
"The next day, I go out – determined to give being a grown-up"
"woman a try – and purchase my first pair of high heels. I still haven’t"
"quite got it – the heels I finally, triumphantly, purchase are sky-blue"
"jelly sandals with a block heel from Barratts, £9.99. They make my"
"feet sweat so much I squeak slightly as I walk – like I’ve used mice"
"as insoles, and they’re all slowly being crushed to death. They’re"
"also quite painful in both the toe and heel area – but no matter! I am"
"in heels! I am a woman!"
"That night, trying to negotiate a staircase in them at a gig, I"
"stumble, and fall right on top of Graham Coxon from Blur, spilling"
"my whisky and coke all down his leg."
"‘ARGH!’ Graham shouts."
"‘These are my great weapons in the style wars,’ I say, sadly."
"‘No one messes with a woman in heels. I am a woman.’"
"‘ARGH!’ Graham says again, staring at his wet leg. ‘You"
"fucking idiot.’"
"I do not give in easily, though. Thirteen years on and I now have both"
"a great many more pairs of high heels and, indeed, a great many"
"more anecdotes about how wearing them has ended badly for me."
"In fact, I have a whole box full of such shoes under my bed. Each"
"pair was bought as a down payment on a new life I had seen in a"
"magazine, and subsequently thought I would attain, now I had the"
"‘right’ shoes. Here they are. Here are all the shoes I don’t wear:"
"1) Silver, ankle-strap wedges from Kurt Geiger. I wore"
"them: once, at an awards ceremony. I got three"
"compliments – YES – but also noticed that my gait in"
"them was slightly less feminine and confident than that"
"of Dame Edna Everage, 82, who was also at the event."
"2) Red velvet court shoes, Topshop. Worn them: once,"
"to a birthday dinner in Soho. Despite the fact I was"
"sitting down all evening, the shoes were so tight and"
"painful that I had to ease my feet out of them."
"Subsequently, things got a bit ‘interesting’ and, when I"
"woke up in the morning, I was only wearing one of them."
"The other, I vaguely remembered putting on top of a"
"toilet cistern ‘to be safe’, in that all-night Spanish bar"
"round the back of the HMV Megastore on Oxford Street."
"3) Grey velvet court, exactly the same as the red velvet"
"court, save the colour. ‘Good to have this versatile shoe"
"in a neutral colour, as well!’, I thought. Man, I’m good at"
"buying shoes!"
"4) Peacock-blue three-inch heels with ruffle on the front."
"At the party I wore them to, I ended up talking to Noddy"
"Holder from Slade – someone who, as Wolverhampton"
"Royalty, I’ve spent my whole life waiting to meet. Alas,"
"however enthusiastically I tried to immerse myself in"
"Noddytopia, it was an undeniable fact that, by now, my"
"feet were hurting so badly I was standing alternately on"
""
"one, then the other, with tears in my eyes. Eventually I"
"had to excuse myself from talking to my idol, and sit in a"
"corridor, massaging the balls of my feet, and wincing."
"5) Same again, but in white. ‘Good to have this versatile"
"shoe in a neutral colour, as well!’ I thought. Man, I’m"
"good at buying shoes!"
"6) A pair of curly-toed Turkish slippers in silver-grey and"
"berry-red. Like 90 per cent of purchases women make"
"of unwearably batshit gear, in my head, I thought, The"
"kind of thing Kate Moss would slip into, when popping"
"out for fags, as I handed over my debit card. And, like 90"
"per cent of women after they have done this, I had to"
"subsequently admit that what has a reptilian, boho edge"
"on Kate Moss looks like that game where you have to"
"put on a hat, gloves and scarf before eating a bar of"
"chocolate with a knife and fork, on me. But in a bad way."
"There are another six pairs – gold gladiator sandals that work by"
"way of a toe tourniquet; brown ankle boots that, overnight, went from"
"‘grungey’ to ‘looking like something an uptight woman called"
"Barbara would wear’; those Doc Marten T-bar shoes that were so"
"heavy, I genuinely thought I was developing ME the first – and,"
"subsequently, last – time I wore them."
"And yet, my understanding is that my collection of Shoes I"
"Don’t Wear – lined up neatly in a box under my bed, looking like a"
"Terracotta Army, Size 6 – is a fairly modest one, within the spectrum"
"of Women’s Unworn Shoe Collections. I have one friend who has"
"27 pairs of heels she can’t bear to part with – and yet has worn only"
"once, twice or not at all. All women have one of these caches of"
"shoes hidden, somewhere, in the house."
"Why are all these shoes unworn? Ladies, I’m going to put it"
"on the line. I’m going to say what, over the 13 years, I have gradually"
"realised, and what we all secretly knew anyway, the first time we put"
"heels on: that there’s only ten people in the world, tops, who should"
"actually wear heels. And six of those are drag queens. The rest of"
"us just need to … give up. Surrender. Finally acquiesce to what"
"nature is telling us. We can’t walk in them. WE CANNOT WALK IN"
"THE DAMN THINGS. We might just as well be stepping out in antigravity boots, or roller skates."
"The unwearability of high heels is self-evidently all around us"
"– coming to a head at the average wedding reception, a uniformly"
"high-heeled occasion. In our minds, we see it as a serene and"
"elegant gathering of women in their finest. One of the big chances"
"of the year to pretend you’re at the Oscars, in your stilettos. In"
"actuality, of course, it looks like the annual AGM of the Tina Turner"
"Impressionist Union – women staggering around in unaccustomed"
"verticality; foot-flesh spilling out over tight, unkind satin; toes going"
"numb for days afterwards."
"The very few who can walk elegantly in them look amazing, of"
"course – walking in heels is a skill as impressive as being able to"
"tightrope walk, or blow smoke rings. I admire them. I wish them"
"well. I wish I could be them. But they are a tiny minority. For"
"everyone else – the vast majority – we look as inversely elegant as"
"we think we will when we purchase them. We waddle, we go over"
"on our ankles, we can’t dance, and we wince incessantly, whilst"
""
"hissing, ‘These SODDING shoes. My feet are killing me.’"
"By the time the reception kicks in, 80 per cent of the women"
"are barefoot or in tights – the edges of the marquee marked with a"
"tide-line of discarded stilettos, wedges and kitten heels. Women"
"spend more time shopping for shoes for a wedding than they"
"actually spend wearing them at the wedding."
"But, bafflingly, we totally accept the uselessness of heels. We"
"accept it limply, shruggingly. We are indifferent to the thousands of"
"pounds, over a lifetime, we spend on shoes we only wear once, and"
"in great pain. Indeed, we’re oddly proud of it. Women buy shoes and"
"gigglingly say, ‘Of course, they’re agony – I’m just going to have to"
"sit on a barstool all night, and be helped to the toilet by friends, or"
"passers-by,’ despite it sounding as OUTRIGHT INSANE as going,"
"‘I’ve just bought a house – it doesn’t have a roof, of course, so I’m"
"just going to sit in the front room with an umbrella up.’"
"So why do we believe that wearing heels is an intrinsic part of being"
"a woman, despite knowing it doesn’t work? Why do we fetishise"
"these things that almost universally make us walk like mad ducks?"
"Was Germaine Greer right? Is the heel just to catch the eyes of"
"men, and get laid?"
"The answer is, of course, no. Women wear heels because"
"they think they make their legs look thinner, ENDOV. They think that"
"by effectively walking on tip-toes, they’re slimming their legs down"
"from a size 14 to a size 10. But they aren’t, of course. There is a"
"precedent for a big fat leg dwindling away into a point – and it’s on a"
"pig."
"And most men distrust, and even dislike, a heel. They often"
"view them with Feud Eyes. This is because:"
"a) A chick in heels makes a man feel shorter. In man"
"terms, this is like making a lady feel fatter. They don’t"
"like it."
"b) A woman in heels stands a statistical likelihood of"
"ending up her evening with her shoes in her handbag,"
"barefoot, and demanding a piggyback to the taxi rank in"
"order to ‘keep her tights clean’. Men are invariably the"
"pig whose back is called for. On this basis alone, men"
"fear a woman tottering towards them at the beginning of"
"an evening, already gimlet-eyed with toe pain, and"
"sitting down to eat with an old-lady sigh."
"At 35, I’ve jacked it in. I’ve finally given up on heels – apart from one"
"pair of yellow tap shoes that are inexplicably comfortable, and"
"something from the 1930s in green velvet that I can dance in."
"Indeed, I’ve pretty much given up on women’s shoes altogether."
"Even women’s flats seem insubstantial and sloppily made,"
"compared to men’s. I’ve got men’s riding boots, men’s biker boots,"
"men’s brogues, some Doc Martens – all beautifully made,"
"comfortable, cheaper than the ones in the women’s section, and a"
"pleasingly contrary end to a leg one expects to terminate in a"
"spindly, painful point."
"I’ve decided I’m now essentially on strike when it comes to"
""
"women’s shoes. I’m going to sit out the entire world of chick"
"footwear until designers make some that it’s possible to walk in, for"
"more than an hour, with the easy gait of Gene Kelly about to break"
"into a routine, and no day-long pain afterwards. I fully realise my"
"demands viz footwear are wholly a minority interest at the moment –"
"who knows how long the after-effects of Sex and the City’s decadelong Blahnik-wank will continue to rumble through society – but I’m"
"pretty determined about this. After all, I’ve seen those pictures of"
"Victoria Beckham’s bare, bebunioned feet. I don’t want toes that"
"look like thalidomide pasties. If I’m going to spunk £500 on a pair of"
"designer shoes, it’s going to be a pair that I can a) dance to ‘Bad"
"Romance’ in, and b) will allow me to run away from a murderer,"
"should one suddenly decide to give chase. That’s the minimum I"
"ask from my footwear. To be able to dance in it, and for it not to get"
"me murdered."
""
"Handbags"
"Of course, the other fashion item women are supposed to go mad"
"for is the handbag. We’ve long known why – apart from shoes, a"
"handbag is the only other item you’re never too fat to fit into. No one"
"ever got dysmorphic and weeping in a changing room trying on a"
"tote."
"By the age of 35, I’ve had two children, paid off half my"
"mortgage, got drunk with Lady Gaga, make my own guacamole, can"
"do 30 seconds of the easy bit of the ‘Single Ladies’ dance, have two"
"contrary opinions about globalisation, know the Heimlich"
"manoeuvre and once scored 420 in Scrabble."
"But I’m also still dipping into those women’s magazines, and"
"they are making me feel genuinely bad about my life achievements."
"Because I don’t yet have an ‘investment handbag’."
"My stance on ‘investment handbags’ has always been that if I"
"were going to make a £600 investment, it would probably be in Post"
"Office bonds – and not something that, by and large, lives on the"
"floor in pubs, or which I sometimes use to carry 5lb of potatoes"
"home. But I am becoming aware that I am in a handbag minority."
"Normal women, says Grazia, do not buy one handbag every five"
"years for £45 from Topshop – my personal ‘handbag routine’."
"Normal women have dozens of handbags: small ones, potato-less"
"ones, £600 investment ones such as a Mulberry tote."
"With mounting concern, I learnt that having a £600 handbag is"
"like having a crush on The Joker in Batman. You MUST do it. It is an"
"irreducible fact of being a woman."
"Things were brought to a head in the now-defunct Observer"
"Woman magazine. Lorraine Candy, Elle’s editor-in-chief, tried to go"
"a week with just high street gear. On the Wednesday she writes:"
"‘I’ve failed. Today, I know that I cannot brave that front row with its"
"cool bags and sexy ankle boots without the one thing that makes"
"my outfit work: my new Chloé bag. I feel ashamed.’"
"I had a flush of horror as I read this: no one had ever passed"
"judgement on my cheap handbag to my face. But then, this is a"
"reserved country. I don’t know how they would react to my £45"
"handbag somewhere more demonstrative – Portugal, say, or"
"Texas. They might leap on to their chairs screaming ‘MAH GAHD!’,"
"trying to hit my cheap handbag with a broom, as if it were vermin."
"That night, I made a decision. One of the modern wisdoms of"
"womanhood is that eBay has fake designer handbags that you can’t"
"tell from the real thing. But despite typing ‘great fake £600"
"handbags for £100’ into the ‘Search’ field, nothing came up."
"Genuinely intrigued, I searched for £600 handbags for £600."
"Vuitton, Prada, Chloé; £300, £467, £582."
"God, they were horrible. Like Guernica, in pony skin. I tried to"
"find one I liked. I really did. Tanned, tasselled and oddly shapeless,"
"many resembled Tom Jones’s knackers, with handles. Others were"
"covered in straps, buckles and brasses, like some S&M horse."
"There was a whole shelf of leather clutches with gigantic gold"
"clasps that looked a bit as if someone melted Grace Jones in 1988,"
"leaving behind only her blouson leather jacket and huge earrings."
"On page 14 of my search results I finally saw one I liked, by"
""
"Marc Jacobs. It was bright, acid-house yellow, with a picture of"
"Debbie Harry on it. But my joy in finding a £600 bag I liked was"
"mitigated when, on closer inspection, it proved to be a canvas tote,"
"for £17; basically, the only designer item I was attracted to was a"
"Marc Jacobs carrier bag."
"I am not wholly unfashionable. I have learnt some things"
"about style over the years. A bright yellow shoe is surprisingly"
"versatile; patterned tights are never a good idea. And if – through"
"chaos, fate and backed-up laundry – you end up in an outfit of"
"alarming randomness (socks, Crocs, tuxedo jacket and tricorn hat),"
"you just look people in the eye and say, with crocodilian selfassurance: ‘I don’t like to be too … matchy-matchy.’"
"But if I cannot connect with the finer things in life, and all I can"
"emotionally connect with is a jumped-up carrier bag, it’s just further"
"confirmation that I am resolutely of the underclass."
"If I’m honest, the handbag I would probably like most is a big,"
"hollowed-out potato with handles on it. A giant King Edward with"
"satchel straps. Then, in times of crisis, I could bake and eat the"
"handbag, and survive the winter. That is the way of my people."
"And yet, despite all this, my handbag psychology denial"
"rumbled on. Yes, those £600 handbags might be visually"
"unappealing, I thought to myself. But maybe if you touch them, they"
"have some manner of £600 magic that makes it all worthwhile."
"‘They will all be made of butter-soft leather,’ I told myself, not"
"really knowing what that meant. ‘You can always tell the difference"
"close up. I should go and touch the quality.’"
"I went to Liberty and walked around, touching the handbags,"
"waiting for the enchantment to overwhelm me. They all just felt like"
"handbags. I did, however, see a silvery purse that I liked. For £225."
"I am classy after all!, I thought, running to the till, immediately"
"incurring a £40 overdraft fine and a rumbling schism in my"
"marriage. ‘Maybe I have a secret uncle who’s an earl! True breeding"
"will out! Finally I crave expensive designer items! I’m normal! Thank"
"you, Grazia!’"
"Five days later the silver purse was pickpocketed on Gower"
"Street. It turns out that thieves read Grazia, too. They can spot"
"expensive accessories from 500 yards away."
"It also turns out that husbands do not read Grazia, and no"
"matter how magnificent or loving they may be, they can’t help"
"themselves from sporadically saying ‘£225! For a purse! JESUS"
"CHRIST’, as if you’ve just stabbed them quite violently in the balls"
"with a fork, left the fork there, and then hung your coat on it, while"
"you go and have a bath."
"My current purse cost £25 from the cobblers in Crouch End. I"
"doubt I will be ‘upgrading’ it any time soon."
"Anyway, let’s face it: the actual handbag is neither here nor"
"there – it’s what you keep in it that’s the most important thing. I have"
"– after years of extensive study on the subject – come up with the"
"definitive list of what you ACTUALLY need in your handbag:"
"1) Something that can absorb huge quantities of liquid"
"2) Eyeliner"
"3) Safety pin"
"4) Biscuit"
""
"This covers all eventualities. You will need nothing else."
""
"Clothes"
"So that’s my feet, and what I’m keeping my fags in. But what am I"
"wearing, now? As a strident feminist, how am I dressed?"
"Women know clothes are important. It’s not just because our"
"brains are full of ribbons and bustles and cocktail frocks – although"
"I believe brain scans will finally prove that at some future point. It’s"
"because, when a woman walks into a room, her outfit is the first"
"thing she says, before she even opens her mouth. Women are"
"judged on what they wear in a way men would find"
"incomprehensible – they have never felt that uncomfortable moment"
"where someone assesses what you’re wearing, and then starts"
"talking down to you, or start perving you, or presumes you won’t"
"‘understand’ the conversation – be it about work, parenting or"
"culture – simply because of what you put on that day."
"‘Wait!’ you often feel like saying. ‘If I were wearing my"
"collegiate corduroy jacket, instead of this school-run dress, you"
"would include me in your conversation about Jung! If you could see"
"my “politically engaged” shoes, no way would you talk about Tony"
"Benn like that to me! Look! I can show you a picture of it, on my"
"iPhone! I HAVE AN OUTFIT FOR THIS OCCASION – JUST NOT ON"
"ME!’"
"Of course, those instances are merely vexatious – classed in"
"with ‘wrong’ outfits that make you feel demoralised the first time you"
"catch your reflection in a shop window, and lead to you making"
"subsequent bad ‘I am fat’ decisions – like panic-buying harem"
"pants, or a disappointing ‘slimline’ sandwich."
"In the worst-case scenario, however, a wrong outfit can ruin"
"your life. It can lead to a judge dismissing your rape case, as"
"evidenced in the 2008 ‘Skinny Jeans’ case (where it was claimed a"
"woman wearing skinny jeans couldn’t have been raped, because"
"no man could take a woman’s skinny jeans off unaided); or"
"Amnesty International’s survey, which found that 25 per cent of"
"people believe a woman is still to blame for being raped if she"
"dresses ‘provocatively’."
"Women know that a woman dressed in a relaxed, casual or"
"even scruffy manner in the workplace is likely to be considered far"

"I’d never really realised how much fashion isn’t ‘on my side’"
"until I did a fashion shoot for The Times. The idea was to get a"
"‘normal woman’ to wear the upcoming season’s trends: pastels,"
"safari, op-art prints, corsets as outerwear, and decorated leggings."
"‘We’ll make you look gorgeous,’ the editor promised. ‘We’ve"
"got an amazing stylist and photographer. We’ll take care of you.’"
"The following eight hours were the worst of my life that haven’t"
"ended in an episiotomy. Previously, I’d always thought that all that"
"lay between me and looking like Kate Winslet on the red carpet was"
"£10,000’s worth of clothes, hair, make-up, stylist and good"
"photographer. And, sure enough, in resulting photos, I looked pretty"
"good. They got some frames of me looking pretty hot in a corset,"
"silk combat trousers and four-inch heels. To be honest, if I’d seen"
"the picture of me in a magazine in that outfit, I would have thought, I"
"will try that outfit! That looks good on her! And she has an arse a lot"
"like mine, although a little bigger, hahaha!"
"That was just the frames, though: the one position it worked"
"in. It took us 20 minutes, half an hour, an hour to find that one"
"position the outfits looked good in. The rest of the time, it was"
"dealing with the camel-toe here, the upper-arm fat there, the muffintop bulge the other. The clothes were stretched, pegged, tied on"
"with string – the lighting changed, the hair arranged; hats brought"
"in, in an emergency, to balance cruelly proportioned shoulders. I felt"
"like a pig. Aclumpy, awkward pig out of her league. I was supposed"
"to be selling these clothes by finding the ‘best’ angle for them,"
"fronting them, working them – but my tits were wrong, and my arse"
"too big, and my arms helpless, heavy and exposed. I left that studio,"
"eight hours later, sweaty and in tears. It was the ugliest I’d ever felt."
"Without even the aid of being able to smile – ‘Look mysterious, and"
"sexy. Kind of … vague’ – I was reduced entirely down to the clothes"
"on my back, and how my body looked in them. And in these styles,"
"rather than the ones I’ve carefully collected as being ‘helpful’ to me,"
"I was a total failure."
"I’m not stupid – I’d always known the difference between"
"models and normal women is that normal women buy clothes to"
"make them look good; whereas the fashion industry buys models to"

"sideways, ungainly, like a horse on its hind legs."
"‘Oh no,’ the stylist said, cheerfully. ‘They fall over in them all"
"the time, too. They’re impossible to walk in. No one can walk in"
"them. Hahaha!’"
"I thought again about my years of despair at not being able to"
"walk in heels, despite ‘everyone’ wearing them. Quite a lot of the"
"‘everyone’, I now reflected, were in fashion shoots, or on a red"
"carpet. i.e. they weren’t really wearing them as ‘shoes’, to walk"
"around in all day. They were just wearing them for the photographs."
"They know it’s just for photographs. We – the customers – are the"
"only ones who are buying this stuff, and then trying to walk around in"
"it all day; move in it; live in it."
"So much of this stuff is just for tableaux – not real life, I finally"
"realised. Although we use it as our major study aid, fashion does"
"not, ultimately, help us get dressed in the morning. Not if we want to"
"wear something we can walk around in without constantly having"
"the hem ride up, or picking the seam out of our crotches. Fashion is"
"for standing still and being photographed. Clothes, on the other"
"hand, are for our actual lives. And life is really the only place you can"
"learn the most important lessons about how to get dressed and"
"feel happy."
"Here, then, is what I have learned about clothes – ignoring"
"magazines and advertising campaigns, and picking up the"
"knowledge where it matters: a) crying in a changing room in"
"Topshop, whilst stuck in a pair of PVC leggings, b) running down"
"the street after someone who looks amazing, and saying ‘Where"
"did you get that?’1 or c) my sister Weena coming into the bedroom,"
"seeing what I’m wearing, going ‘No’ and walking out of the room"
"again—"
"1) Leopardskin is a neutral."
"2) You can get away with nearly anything if you wear the"
"thing with black opaque tights and boots."
"3) Contrary to popular opinion, a belt is often not a good"
"friend to a lady. Indeed in many circumstances, it acts"
"merely as a visual aid to help the onlooker settle the"
"question: ‘Which half is fatter – the bottom or the top?’"
"4) Bright red is a neutral."
"5) Sellotape is NOT strong enough to mend a hole in"
"the crotch of a pair of tights."
"6) You should NOT buy an outfit if you have to strike a"
"sexy pose in the changing-room mirror to make it look"
"good. On the other hand, if you immediately start"
"dancing the minute you put it on, buy it, however much it"
"costs; unless it’s lots, in which case, you can’t, so don’t."
"Fashion magazines will never say, ‘Actually, don’t buy it"
"if you can’t afford it.’ Neither will your friends. I am"
"probably the only person who will EVER say it to you."
"You’re welcome."
"7) You should never describe your look as being ‘a"
"mixture of high street and vintage’. Remember how"
"angry it makes you when Fearne Cotton says it. Don’t let"
"the abused become the abuser."
"8) You are very, very unlikely to look bad in an abovethe-knee, fitted, 1950s-style dress with sleeves and a"
"cardigan. Have you seen what Christina Hendricks – the"
""
"stacked, hot Joan Holloway in Mad Men, the woman"
"Vanity Fair recently christened ‘The Body’ – looks like in"
"modern combat trousers and a top? Awful. There’s a"
"lesson for us all there."
"9) The most flattering trousers you’ll ever have are"
"some black running trousers with a fiercely high Lycra"
"content. They make your thighs and arse look tiny. You"
"spend over two years trying to pluck up the courage to"
"wear them out with a pair of knee-high boots and a"
"jacket, but always bottle it at the last minute. It is a"
"source of lasting regret."
"10) Silver lamé is a neutral."
"11) Ditto gold sequin."
"12) Instead of buying something that says ‘Dry clean"
"only’, just put £50 in the garment’s pocket, and walk out"
"of the shop, leaving both on the hanger. In the long run it"
"will save you money, time, and the unedifying spectacle"
"of you squirting Sure Extra onto the armpits, in an"
"emergency, on a train on the way to a meeting."
"13) Everything from Per Una at Marks & Spencer makes"
"you look a little bit mental. I don’t know why this should"
"be so, but it is true."
"And this is what I have learned about fashion."
"1Sadly, the answer is almost always, ‘An amazing vintage shop in"
""
"Rotterdam, four years ago, that has now sadly burned down in a"
"fire, and which you wouldn’t have been allowed in anyway,’ but I still"

"Why You Should Have Children"
""
"A Bad Birth"
"It was no surprise at all to me to discover I was terrible at giving"
"birth. No surprise at all. All that I know about birth is what I’ve seen"
"from my mother – returning after delivering every sibling as white as"
"death; hobbling into the house seven times with a bad story: a"
"breech, an emergency Caesarean, a trapped nerve, a tangled cord."
"For her fifth – Corinne – the placenta didn’t come away, and an"
"inexperienced midwife simply took hold of the umbilical cord and"
"pulled it, like a dog lead attached to a recalcitrant beagle. My mother"
"haemorrhaged so badly they had to give her four pints of blood, and"
"when they sent her home, it was like having someone return, shellshocked, from a war."
"I was 11 – I carried the baby around like a cross between a"
"doll and a baby monkey. We were all in fear of Mum suddenly"
"collapsing again. She fainted in the supermarket; halfway up the"
"stairs. It seemed like the baby was something that was essential to"
"her, and should have stayed inside. She seemed broken without it."
"The next baby – Cheryl, two years later – was worse. Mum"
"came back with a trapped nerve in her shoulder, and couldn’t move"
"– she lay in the front room with the curtains drawn, through a long"
"hot summer, crying, as the house descended into a hot soup of"
"mould, ants and scared children. Thirteen now – I fed the family on"
"tins of cheap hot dogs, and crackers and jam; the new baby monkey"
"in a cardboard box at my feet, along with the old one. It was awful"
"until late September, when the hot weather breaks, and Mum finally"
"started to walk around again, slowly; killing the ants with hot water"
"and bleach."
"So when I become pregnant at 24, I both know how to look"
"after a baby – you put them in a cardboard box, and eat tinned hot"
"dogs – and dread one coming out. Frankly, I don’t think I can do it. I"
"don’t know how you do it. I’m insanely, wilfully ignorant. At my sixmonth check-up, I comment on an odd, modern sculpture above the"
"bed. In white plastic, it seems to show ten pupil-less eyes getting"
"gradually wider, as if in alarm."
"‘What’s that?’ I ask, cheerfully. ‘Is it a rip-off Jeff Koons?’"
"‘It’s the stages of cervical dilation,’ the midwife says, puzzled."
"‘From nought to ten centimetres.’"
"‘The … cervix?’ I say. ‘Why does the cervix dilate?’"
"‘That’s how the baby comes out,’ the midwife says, now"
"looking like she’s talking to a madwoman. ‘That’s what labour is –"
"the cervix gradually dilating, to let the baby out.’"
"‘The cervix?’ I repeat, wholly alarmed. ‘A baby can’t come out"
"of that! It’s not a hole! I’ve felt it! That’s a solid thing!’"
"‘Well, that’s why it’s all a … bit of an effort,’ the midwife"
"replies, as diplomatically as she can."
"At that point, I know I can’t have a baby. The me-maths just"
"aren’t adding up. I can’t open my cervix. I wouldn’t even know where"
"to start."
"So all the way through pregnancy – through the jolly doctors and"
"can-do midwives – I feel pityingly sorry for them every time they refer"
"to my forthcoming labour. It’s not going to happen, I say to myself. I"
"feel as if they’ve all – nurses, obstetricians, my husband – been told"
""
"that, in nine months’ time, I am going to put on a magic show, and"
"will miraculously fly around the room like Peter Pan, or – almost"
"literally – make monkeys fly out of my butt. The chairs are all set up"
"and the audience is patiently waiting."
"But I, of course, know I am not magic. I know I don’t have one"
"single half-ounce of enchantment in my entire body. I’ve tried"
"everything I can to encourage magic to happen – the birthing pool is"
"set up in the front room, surrounded by candles waiting to be lit. I"
"have herbs and music and things to burn. I am ready to cast the"
"spell – but as I go first one and then two weeks over my due date, I"
"feel like a failed shaman pointing my staff at the sky, shouting"
"‘BEHOLD! THE RAIN!’ as the crops continue to wither in the fields"
"and the womenfolk wail."
"When my contractions finally start, they are painful, yet"
"useless. The baby is in the unfortunate posterior position – her"
"skull grinds against my spine – and the midwives sadly explain that"
"although the magic has started, I have accidentally, in my"
"ignorance, called on bad magic, instead: posterior labours are long,"
"arduous and unsatisfying. After 24 sleepless hours, they suggest"
"hospital. I cry. They insist."
"And in the brightness of the ward, confronted with the modern,"
"sleek, beeping wonder of technology, the magic disappears"
"completely. The shaman is revealed just to be an old man with a"
"stick, and shuffles away, never to be seen again: the contractions"
"stop entirely."
"A sour-faced Swedish midwife assesses me as I sit on the"
"bed, weeping."
"‘This is what often happens with the mummies who say they"
"want a home birth,’ she says, with some satisfaction, as she opens"
"my legs, and inserts a hook – to monitor heart-rate – into my baby’s"
"head. Poor baby! Poor baby! I’m so sorry! This is not what I"
"dreamed your first touch to be! ‘They end up having to come in here,"
"and get their tummies cut open.’"
"Finally, I have met someone who realises what I have known"
"all along. This bitch sees me for what I am: incapable."
"From Saturday night until Monday morning, the NHS slowly"
"and dutifully goes through its list of actions to bail out failed women."
"My waters are unbroken – they break them with a crotchet hook. My"
"contractions have stopped – they jump-start them with a pessary."
"My cervix is unyielding – painfully, they sweep it, just as a contraction"
"starts. It is a sensation a little like being diced, internally, at the start"
"of slow murder."
"They are helping me because they have to, of course: these"
"are all things the female body is supposed to do, automatically, and"
"without fuss – like precipitation, or season change. My waters"
"breaking, my contractions starting – these are all things my body"
"should have done itself, with its innards hidden, like a music box."
"But due to my incompetence, they now have had to prise the"
"casing off, and a roomful of increasingly worried doctors are playing"
"each note by hand – strumming flatly on the teeth of the"
"mechanism. My labour has no rhythm at all. Every beat is being"
"forced."
"Of course, after two days of this bad dance, the baby started,"
"very tentatively and apologetically, to die. On the monitor, her"
"heartbeat sounds like a tiny toy drum. As each contraction squeezes"
"her, you can hear the drum getting fainter – as if the Having A Baby"
""
"parade was passing by in a distant street, or maybe moving away"
"all together."
"I know what comes next – intravenous oxytocin. The Drip. I"
"have read about The Drip. Every book on childbirth teaches you to"
"fear it. When you contract naturally, the body generally does it at a"
"pace and intensity you can handle. The Drip, however, has no such"
"compunction. It only has one speed: fast. It is a brutal machine – a"
"metronome for the unrhythmic. An unstoppable atomic clock that"
"makes you explode into contraction every minute, unfailingly. It is a"
"pace-maker for the womb; like the red shoes in The Red Shoes. It"
"makes you dance until you drop dead."
"The pain was transformative – like going from agnosticism to"
"evangelism in a single hour. The sky was suddenly full of God, and"
"He had biblical pain for me. The breaks in between contractions"
"were like licking a dripping tap in a burning house – a second of"
"relief, but, when you turned back, it was so hot that the moisture"
"burned from your lips; the walls had gone up, and there had never"
"been a door or window in the first place. The only way to get out was"
"to somehow turn inside out, like an octopus, and fly out through the"
"magic doorway in your bones."
"But I was meat and pain, pinned in place by monitor wires,"
"and my mother had never taught me how to turn inside out."
"And in the end – because I wasn’t magic and couldn’t fly"
"monkeys out of my butt, and I’d been three days and nights in this"
"place of failure – the doctors had to strap me down and cut me"
"open. Instead of Lizzie coming out of me in a soft, spurting burst of"
"magic and Milky Way, Dr Jonathan de Rosa pushed my kidneys to"
"one side and hauled her out of me, upside-down by her feet, like a"
"shit-covered rabbit on a butcher’s hook."
"Of course, I haven’t told you the half of it. I haven’t told you about"
"Pete crying, or the shit, or vomiting three feet up a wall, or gasping"
"‘mouth!’ for the gas and air, as I’d forgotten all other words. Or the"
"nerve that Lizzie damaged with her face and how, ten years later, my"
"right leg is still numb and cold. Or the four failed epidurals, which"
"left each vertebra smashed and bruised, and the fluid between"
"them feeling like hot, rotting vinegar. And the most important thing –"
"the shock, the shock that Lizzie’s birth would hurt me so much;"
"would make me an animal with my leg caught in the trap of my own"
"bones, and leave me begging for the doctors to take a knife and cut"
"me free."
"For the next year, every Monday at 7.48am, I would look at the"
"clock and remember the birth, and tremble and give thanks it was"
"all over, and marvel that we both survived."
"Lizzie was born at 8.32am – but 7.48am was when they gave"
"me the anaesthetic, and the pain, finally, stopped."
"Now, it’s Monday morning. I am on my narrow hospital bed, with"
"everything suddenly quiet and calm, and a saline drip in my hand,"
"and a morphine shot in my leg, and my husband on a chair, and my"
"daughter in a glass cot, and not even flowers on the cabinet, it’s still"
"so early and new. My eyes are huge with morphine. When I look at"
"the photographs later, I look gorgeous. Like Stevie Nicks, wasted,"
"on Mulholland Drive, but incongruously next to a baby."
""
"Pete looks like shit. I didn’t notice it at the time, because,"
"without pain, everything – even old, brown blood stains and the"
"punishing strip-lighting – looked beautiful; but the picture that Caz"
"and Weena take of him when they arrive, ten minutes later, shows a"
"man with cried-red eyes and pale green skin, from exhaustion and"
"fear and drinking all my Lucozade."
"His eyes are filled with tears, he can only look at me like I am"
"going to die, and he is going to miss me more than he could ever"
"explain."
"‘Pete,’ I say, putting my hand out to him. It has a drip in the"
"back of it. Pete looks scared to touch it."
"‘Everything they did hurt you,’ he said, and started crying."
"Really awful crying, with his mouth all liquid; strings of spit between"
"the lips. ‘I couldn’t do anything. Every time I thought it was going to"
"get better, they just did something that made you worse. When they"
"put that thing in your back [the first of three failed shunts for the"
"epidural] they were saying the pain would stop – but it went in wrong"
"and you screamed, and wet yourself. They ran with the trolley down"
"the hall. You were making this terrible sound.’"
"I look into the glass cot, and tap my finger on the side, like"
"people do on goldfish bowls. Lizzie opens her eyes for a second,"
"and stares, with wrinkled monkey brow, at me. Her face looks red"
"against the hospital sheet. She still looks like an internal organ."
"She has no white in her eyes – just black. Just huge pupils – two"
"big holes in her monkey head, that lead straight to her monkey"
"brain. She stares at me. I stare back at her."
"Pete and I look up at each other. We both know we want to"
"smile at each other; but we cannot."
"We look back at the baby."
"Pain is transformative. We are programmed for it to be the fastest"
"lesson we’ll ever learn. I learned two things from the first baby I had:"
"1) That being very unfit, attending only two NCT birth"
"classes, and genuinely believing that I would probably"
"die was not a good way to prepare for labour, all things"
"told."
"2) That once you have experienced that level of pain, the"
"rest of your life becomes relatively easy. However awful"
"an experience, it’s really not wasted."
"Because you know what you get along with 27 stitches in your belly,"
"or seventh- to second-degree tears in your perineum? Perspective."
"A whole heap of perspective. I do not mean this in a – to use the"
"technical term – ‘wanky way’. But in many cases, a furious, 24-hour"
"dose of wildly intolerable pain sorts out many of the more fretful,"
"dolorous aspects of modern life."
"It is like a mental bushfire. You get rid of a lot of emotional"
"deadwood. Do you currently get wound up about poor customer"
"service, or ill-made sandwiches, or how your legs look? You won’t"
"when you’ve been dragged backwards through the brightly burning"
"gates of hell during a 48-hour labour!"
"In that respect, childbirth is far superior to Sertraline, or"
""
"therapy. Fairly early on in the event, you will have the most dazzlingly"
"simple revelation of your life: that the only thing that really matters, in"
"this whole goddamn crazy mixed-up world, is whether or not there’s"
"something the size of a cat stuck in your cervix, and that any day"
"when you do not have a cat stuck in your cervix will be, by default,"
"wholly perfect in every way."
"Around the time that a man with giant hands comes towards"
"you with some forceps the size of BBQ tongs, you think, Perspective."
"Yes, yes I do have some perspective now. I doubt that I will get"
"angry about Norwich Union changing its name to ‘Aviva’ ever again."
"To be frank, childbirth gives a woman a gigantic set of balls."
"The high you get as you realise it’s all over, and that you didn’t"
"actually die, can last the rest of your life. Off their faces with"
"euphoria, and bucked by how brave they were, new mothers finally"
"tell the in-laws to back off, dye their hair red, get driving lessons, go"
"self-employed, learn to use a drill, experiment with Thai"
"condiments, make cheerful jokes about incontinence, and stop"
"being scared of the dark."
"In short, a dose of pain that intense turns you from a girl into a"
"woman. There are other ways of achieving the same effect – as"
"outlined in Chapter 15 – but minute for minute, it’s one of the most"
"effective ways of changing your life. If I compare how I am now to"
"who I was before I gave birth for the first time, the transformation is"
"almost total. Opening my cervix opened my ‘doors of perception’"
"more than drugs ever did – to be frank, all I learned from Ecstasy"
"was that, if you’re caned enough, you can dance on a podium to"
"someone saying ‘Time to go home now, ladies and gentlemen’"
"over and over again on a PA."
"Birth, on the other hand, taught me a great many things."
"Before my first labour, here’s a list of what I was scared of: the dark."
"Demons. UFO invasion. The sudden dawning of a new Ice Age. The"
"often-reported phenomenon of ‘The Hag’ – where a sleeper wakes"
"up to find themselves paralysed, with a hag sitting on their chest."
"Scary movies. Pain. Hospitals. General anaesthetic. Insanity. Death."
"Going up or down a very tall ladder. Spiders. Speaking in public."
"Talking to people with very strong foreign or regional accents."

"Lighting fireworks. Asking for help, unusually rapid incoming tides,"
"and ever being sent, in a professional capacity, to interview Lou"
"Reed – who is infamously very grumpy."

"Child Rearing"
"Indeed, in the early years of motherhood, all the similes I could think"
"of involved pugilism, battle and mettle. Those with no children are"
"apt to think of parenthood as some winsome idyll, primarily"
"revolving around warm milk, bubble-blowing and hugs."
"For those engaged in it, however, the language is often"
"military; bordering, at times, on Colonel Kurtz in Vietnam. Many"
"consider Marlon Brando’s turn in Apocalypse Now as one of the"
"bravura performances of Hollywood. Personally, I suspect he’d"
"recently looked after colicky three-month-old twins for a week, and"
"based it on that."
"The parallels to war are multiple: you wear the same clothes,"
"day in, day out; you keep saying, hopefully, ‘It’ll all be over by"
"Christmas’; it’s long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of"
"sheer terror; you get repeatedly infested by vermin; no one seems to"
"know what’s really going on; you will only talk about the true realities"
"of your experiences with other veterans; and you often find yourself"
"lying in the middle of a field in France, at 4am, crying for your mother"
"– although the latter tends to be because you’ve contracted mastitis"

"of being a mother from a more positive angle."
"Firstly, and most obviously, there is the sheer emotional,"
"intellectual, physical, chemical pleasure of your children. The"
"honest truth is that the world holds no greater gratification than lying"
"in bed with your children, putting your leg on top of them, in a semicrushing manner, whilst saying, sternly, ‘You are a poo.’"
"£15,000 bottles of vintage champagne; hot-air balloons flying"
"over wildebeest migrations; sharkskin shoes with a diamond on the"

"who don’t have access to a small, ideally slightly grubby child that"
"they can mess around with, poke and squash a little – high on"
"ridiculous love."
"It’s the silliness – the profligacy, and the silliness – that’s so"
"dizzying: a seven-year-old will run downstairs, kiss you hard, and"
"then run back upstairs again; all in less than 30 seconds. It’s as"
"urgent an item on their daily agenda as eating, or singing. It’s like"
"being mugged by Cupid."
"You, in turn, observe yourself from a distance, simply"
"astonished by the quantities of love you manufacture. It is endless."
"Your adoration may grow weary but it will never end: it becomes the"

"the pouring rain, delivering forgotten raincoats for lunch-time play;"
"works overtime, paying for shoes and puppets; keeps you up all"
"night, easing cough, fever and pain – like lust used to, but much,"
"much stronger."

"Currently, ten years down the line, I can tell you what I’ve got"
"out of it, so far. It’s a surprisingly good deal:"
"ONE: A superlative understanding of how long an hour is. Before I"
"had children, I could spend an hour doing absolutely nothing."
"Nothing. Indeed, an hour was chickenfeed. I could spend whole"
"days with absolutely no achievement at all. Ask me how my week"
"had been, and I would puff my cheeks out and go, ‘Phew! I have"
"been flat out! There is no rest for the wicked! It’s end-to-end stuff! I"
"am burning the candle at both ends, my friend’ – when all I had"
"really done was maybe write a single article, and then half-heartedly"
"started sorting out the kitchen drawers, before Big Brother came on,"
"and I left all the egg whisks on the floor, for Pete to tread on."
"Three days after having Lizzie, however, I suddenly realised"
"the riches I had squandered. An hour! Oh man, what I could do with"
"an hour now! Sitting on a rocking chair, holding a fitfully sleeping"
"newborn – remote control tantalisingly out of reach – all I could do"
"was watch the huge railway clock on the wall, slowly ticking away"

"could have my life back, and someone else were holding the baby."
"Oh man, I could be learning French now, if I didn’t have this"

"Why You Shouldn’t Have Children"
"Of course, whilst having children is hard work – a minimum 18-year"
"commitment at full throttle; followed by another 40 years of part-time"
"fretting, money lending and getting on their nerves when you keep"
"cutting their toast into soldiers, even though they’re 38, and a"
"neurosurgeon now – in many ways, it’s the easy option for a"
"woman. Why?"
"Because, if you have children, at least people won’t keep"
"asking you when you’re going to have children."
"Women are always being asked when they’re going to have"
"children. It’s a question they’re asked even more often than, ‘Can I"
"help you, madam?’, when they’ve just come into a shop to make a"
"mobile call somewhere quieter, or ‘Can’t you clip that fringe back?"
"You’ve got a lovely face,’ by their nan."
"For some reason, the world really wants to know when"
"women are having children. It likes them to have planned this shit"
"early. It wants them to be very clear and upfront about it – ‘Oh, I’d"
"like a glass of Merlot, the clams, the steak – and a baby when I’m"
"32, please.’"
"It is oddly panicked by women who are being a bit relaxed and"
"‘whevs’ about it all: ‘But your body clock!’ it is apt to shout. ‘You"
"need to be planning at least five years ahead! If you want a baby at"
"34, you need to be engaged by 29, minimum. Chop chop! Find a"
"husband! Look on Ocado! Or you’ll end up like poor barren lonely"
"Jennifer Aniston.’"
"And if a woman should say she doesn’t want to have children"
"at all, the world is apt to go decidedly peculiar:"
"‘Ooooh, don’t speak too soon,’ it will say – as if knowing"
"whether or not you’re the kind of person who desires to make a"
"whole other human being in your guts, out of sex and food, then"
"base the rest of your life around its welfare, is a breezy, ‘Hey –"
"whevs’ decision. Like electing to have a picnic on an unexpectedly"
"sunny day; or changing the background picture on your desktop."
"‘When you meet the right man, you’ll change your mind, dear,’"
"the world will say, with an odd, aggressive smugness."
"My sister Caz – who has been resolute in her desire not to"
"have children since the age of nine – went through a spell of"
"replying to this statement with, ‘When Myra Hindley met her right"
"man, it was Ian Brady.’"
"But she’s stopped now."
"Women, it is presumed, will always end up having babies."
"They might go through silly, adolescent phases of pretending that"
"it’s something that they have no interest in – but, when push comes"
"to shove, womanhood is a cul-de-sac that ends in Mothercare, and"
"that’s the end of that. All women love babies – just like all women"
"love Manolo Blahnik shoes, and George Clooney. Even the ones"
"who wear nothing but trainers, or are lesbians, and really hate"
"shoes, and George Clooney."

"Role Models And What We Do With"
"Them"
"If there is one single thing that gives me hope for the future of"
"female liberation, it has been, over the last few years, watching the"
"fall, and rise, of various female icons. In many ways, it is within the"
"pages of the glossy gossip magazines that the next chapter of"
"feminism has slowly, and incongruously, been taking shape."
"In the interregnum between female emancipation, and female"
"politicians, businesswomen and artists finally coming into true"
"equality, celebrity culture is the forum in which we currently inspect"
"and debate the lives, roles and aspirations of women. Tabloids,"
"magazines and the Daily Mail work by means of turning the lives"
"and careers of a few dozen women into a combination of living soap"
"and daily morality lesson – on the good side, responding to the"
"gigantic desire to examine the modern female condition, but on the"
"bad side, leaving the subjects ostensibly powerless to write their"
"own narrative, or express their own analysis of the matter. This is"
"why any modern feminist worth her salt has an interest in the"
"business of A-list gossip: it is the main place where our perception"
"of women is currently being formed. That’s my excuse for buying"
"OK!, anyway."
"So in the absence of a female Philip Roth scrutinising ageing,"
"death and desire, we have the stories of ‘cougars’ like Demi Moore,"
"Kim Cattrall and Madonna, dating younger men and remaining"
"surgically ‘youthful’. We might not have a female Jay McInerny or"
"Bret Easton Ellis – young, talented and off the rails – but we do have"
"Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears and Amy Winehouse, getting"
"successful absurdly young, and then self-destructing on a hundred"
"sidewalks, and at a thousand parties."
"As these stories get endlessly discussed in the gossip rags,"
"we form our own opinions of both the celebrities themselves"
"(‘Bloody idiot. And horrible hair’) and the way the press treat them"
"(‘Everything they say about her is vile patriarchal bullshit. I wish to"
"GOD Germaine Greer had a gun’). Until we get a proper female"
"canon of artists, these minutely papped lives will have to do."
"Perhaps the most notable case of all – while we still lack a"
"coherent/populist fifth wave of feminist discourse – has been Katie"
"Price, aka Jordan, who has come to embody a whole nexus of"
"female issues. In a capitalist society, Price is an undeniably"
"successful businesswoman – but by dint of selling her personal"
"life. She is powerful – but by dealing in an outwardly old-fashioned"
"notion of female sexuality. And she is independent – but defined,"
"and judged, by her high-profile relationships. Afew years ago, Price"
"was being seriously touted as a feminist icon in broadsheet"
"newspapers – I suspect because, at root, she simply confused"
"cultural commentators to the point of panic. You can see her tits –"
"but also has her own range of bed linen. What’s that all about?"
"I was one of those broadsheet journalists sent to find out"
"whether or not she was a good, feminist role model. In 2006 I spent"
"half a week trailing around after her for a cover story for Elle"
""
"magazine. I ended the whole thing reflecting that I have genuinely"
"interacted with monitor lizards with more warmth than Price. The"
"first time I met her, it was at the photoshoot for the feature. Greeting"
"me with a smile that didn’t reach her teeth, let alone her eyes – but"
"then that’s Botox for you – she was sitting at a mirror, having her"
"make-up done."
"‘There’s something I’d like to say,’ Price said. ‘I’d love to do a"
"mascara ad. All the ones on television are false advertising – they"
"use false eyelashes. But these are real. I would love,’ she"
"reiterated, looking at me in a ‘make sure you put this in the feature’"
"way, ‘to do a mascara ad.’ She prodded her eyelashes with her"
"fingertips to show me how good they were."
"Five minutes later her manager, Claire Powell, took me to one"
"side. ‘We’re thinking Katie’s next move should be a cosmetic advert,"
"make-up endorsement, that kind of thing. That’s where we’re"
"moving to.’"
"Still, at least on this point if we were talking about her"
"eyelashes – Price had something to say. For the next three hours in"
"the studio, every other attempted conversational tactic failed. Books,"
"current affairs, television and movies – Price shrugged at each one."
"When I asked what she did in her spare time, she sank into silence"
"for nearly a minute, and they offered that she liked to stick Swarovski"
"crystals onto household appliances – ‘like the remote control’."
"It became very clear that unless it was a book she’d ‘written’,"
"current affairs she’d taken part in – such as selling exclusive"
"coverage of her wedding for £1 million – or a television show that"
"she’s starred in, Price had absolutely no interest in it whatsoever."
"Her world consisted entirely of herself, her pink merchandise range,"
"and the constant semi-circle of paps minutely photographing this"
"ongoing narrative of solipsism. No wonder her eyes were so blank"
"– she had nothing to think about apart from herself. She’s like the"
"ouroborus – the mythical serpent, forever eating her own tail."
"Perhaps because of this lucrative self-obsession, throughout"
"our time together, she was never less than a charmless, basiliskeyed tyrant, bossing her then-husband Peter Andre around as if he"
"were a piddling puppy, squatting on her best shoes, and infusing"
"every engagement with a world-weary contemptuousness – as if"
"wearing dresses, riding in cars and talking to people was the"
"pastime of a cunt, and she was furious she’s got landed with it."
"At one point she was so rude that Andre had to apologise to"
"everyone in the room – ‘She’ll wear anything apart from a smile, ha"
"ha!’ he said, trying to make a joke of it – as I stood and marvelled at"
"the idea that someone whose sole career consisted of ‘being"
"herself’ was doing it so unappealingly and gracelessly. It was like"
"watching an Olympic sprinter coming off the blocks, sulkily, and"
"then complaining about ‘getting sweaty’; or a rabbit bellyaching"
"about all the sex they were supposed to have."
"There were some fun bits to the week – trying on Price’s"
"wedding ring, which was the size of a pork chop, larded with pink"
"diamonds. And on the last night – at an awards ceremony dinner –"
"Price had a glass of champagne and launched into a furious"
"bitching session about other celebrity females: hissing ‘She’s so"
"false!’ at Caprice and gleefully boasting about how Victoria"
"Beckham had to hire ‘ugly nannies’ in case David Beckham was"
"‘tempted. She can’t trust him to keep his dick in his pants with"
"anyone good looking! I feel sorry for her. All my nannies are"
""
"gorgeous,’ she boasted, flashing a crushing look at Peter Andre."
"But after five days together, on and off, the only real novel"
"‘discovery’ I’d made about Price was that she had, for years, worn"
"the wrong bra size. ‘Marks and Spencers put me in a 34B!’ she"
"said. ‘And when I got measured I found out that I was really a 34GG"
"all along!’"
"I know. It’s scarcely Watergate. But given the rest of my"
"interview, it was the best quote I had. I duly wrote up the piece – only"
"to be emailed the next day by her management. ‘Would you mind"
"not printing the thing about Katie’s bra size?’ her manager asks."
"‘It’s just, we really want to give that as an exclusive to OK!’"
"Flummoxed by a situation where news of a woman’s bra size"
"was literally currency, I capitulated."
"I don’t really mind and one misguidedly thinking that Price is a"
"good businesswoman – despite the fact that she has to rope her"
"kids into her business to make money: something I always"
"associate with desperate Third World families, rather than nice,"
"middle-class girls getting million-pound paycheques. At the end of"
"the day, it’s a busy, mixed-up world and we’ve all got to pick our"
"fights."
"But what I do find intolerable are the people who claim that"
"Price is a feminist role model – simply because she has earned a"
"lot of money."
"The reasoning is this: men still have all the power and money."
"But men have a weak spot – sexy women. So if what it takes to"
"become rich and powerful is to sex up the blokes, then so be it."
"That’s business, baby. You might be on all fours with your arse"
"hanging out in ‘glamour’ calendars but at least you’re making the"
"rent on your enormous pink mansion."
"Well, there’s a phrase for that kind of behaviour. It is, to quote"
"Jamie, the spin doctor in The Thick of It, being a ‘mimsy bastard"
"quisling f***’."
"Women who, in a sexist world, pander to sexism to make their"
"fortune are Vichy France with tits. Are you 32GG, waxed to within an"
"inch of your life and faking orgasms? Then you’re doing business"
"with a decadent and corrupt regime. Calling that a feminist icon is"
"like giving an arms dealer the Nobel Peace Prize."
"‘I’m strong,’ Price will say, in another exclusive interview with"
"OK! But by and large, strong people tend not to go quacking to the"
"press every week about how they’re ‘feeling’ and how unfairly"
"everyone’s treating them, and what an arse their exhusband’s been."
"As Blanche in Corrie said: ‘In my day, when something bad"
"happened, you’d stay at home, get drunk and bite on a shoe.’"
"Price could learn much from this. This idea that Price is"
"‘strong’ has come solely from the fact that she keeps saying ‘I’m"
"strong’, while doing really weak things, like appearing on I’m A"
"Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! so that people can learn ‘the real me’"
"and trying to get out of a dangerous driving fine by saying ‘I’m just a"
"typical woman driver’."
"There’s a similar bit of neurolinguistic programming going on"
"with her being a ‘great parent’, and being voted Celebrity Mum of"
"The Year."
"‘I take care of my kids,’ she says. ‘I love my kids.’"

"to look after your kids, you low-expectation-having motherfucker!"

"make a series of reality TV documentaries about her marriage, get"

"act like a craven, ungrateful, miserable, resentful and hard-bitten"
"curmudgeon – but with huge tits – would surely have re-thought it all"

"was revealed to have been serially unfaithful, suddenly, the idea of"
"aiming to do nothing but hitch your life and livelihood to a famous,"

"nationalities instantly when we commented, excitedly, ‘Oh my God!"
"You can SMOKE in here.’ It seemed a far more thrilling prospect"
"than … some bumming."
"It was a small entourage: Gaga, me, Adrian, her make-up"
"artist, her security guy, and maybe two others. We walked on to the"
"small dance floor, in a club filled with drag queens, lesbians"
"dressed as sailors, boys in tight T-shirts, girls in black leather. The"
"music was pounding. There was a gigantic harness hanging over"
"the bar. ‘For fucking.’ The same helpful German again."
"Gaga headed up our group. Even, like, Keane would slope off"
"to a VIP booth at this point, and wait for people to bring them drinks."
"Instead – cloak billowing, and very much looking like one of the"
"Skeksis in The Dark Crystal – Gaga marched up to the bar, and"
"leaned on it in a practised barfly manner. With a bellowed, ‘What"
"does everyone want to drink?’, she got the round in."
"‘I really love a dingy, pissy bar,’ Gaga says. ‘I’m really oldschool that way.’"
"We went into an alcove with a wipe-clean banquette – ‘For the"
"fucking!’ the German says, again – and set up camp. Gaga took off"
"her McQueen cloak and chucked it into a corner. I promptly stood on"
"it, to the wincing horror of her make-up artist, who carefully removed"
"its £10,000’s worth of taffeta from under my feet. Gaga was now just"
"in bra, fishnets and knickers, with sequins around her eyes."
"‘Do you know what that girl at the bar said to me?’ she said,"
"sipping her Scotch, and taking a single drag off someone’s fag"
"before handing it back. ‘She said, “You’re a feminist. People think it"
"means man-hating, but it doesn’t.” Isn’t that funny?’"
"Earlier in the day, conversation had turned to whether Gaga"
"would describe herself as feminist or not. As the very best"
"conversations about feminism often will, it had segued from robust"
"declarations of emancipation and sisterhood (‘I am a feminist"
"because I believe in women’s rights, and protecting who we are,"
"down to the core’) to musing on who she fancied. (‘In the video to"
"“Telephone”, the girl I kiss, Heather, lives as a man. And as"
"someone who does like women, something about a more"
"masculine woman makes me feel more … feminine. When we"
"kissed, I got that fuzzy butterfly feeling.’)"
"We had concluded that it was odd most women ‘shy away’"
"from declaring themselves feminists, because ‘it really doesn’t"
"mean “man-hating”’."
"‘And now she’s just said the same thing to me! AND she’s"
"hot!’ Gaga beamed. She points to the girl – who looks like an"
"androgynous, Cupid-mouthed, Jean Paul Gaultier cabin boy."
"‘Gorgeous,’ Gaga sighs."
"By 2am, we had drunk a lot of vodka, and Gaga had her head"
"in my lap. I had just come up with the theory that, if you have one of"
"your heroes lying drunkenly in your lap, that’s the time you tell them"
"all the little theses you’ve come up with about them."
"‘Even though you wear very little clothing,’ I said slightly primly,"

"gesturing to Gaga’s bra and thong, ‘you’re not doing all this as a …"
"prick-tease, are you?’"
"‘No!’ Gaga replied, with a big, drunken beam. ‘It’s not what"
"straight men masturbate over when they’re at home watching"
"pornography. It’s not for them. It’s for … us.’"
"And she gestured around the nightclub, filled to the brim with"
"biker-boy lesbians and drag queens."
"Because Gaga is not there to be fucked. You don’t penetrate"
"Gaga. In common with much of pop’s history, and particularly its"
"women – she’s not singing these songs in order to get laid, or give"
"the impression she wants to. She wishes to disrupt, and disturb:"
"sunglasses made of burning cigarette, beds bursting into flame,"
"dresses made of raw meat, calipers made of platinum, Gaga being"
"water-boarded in a bathtub – eyes dilated with CGI so that she"
"looks like her own manga cartoon. Her iconography is"
"disconcerting, and disarranges what we are used to seeing."
"The end point of her songs is not to excite desire in potential"
"lovers but the thrill of examining her own feelings, then expressing"
"them to her listeners, instead. Her gang – the millions-strong army"
"of Gaga fans, who call themselves ‘Little Monsters’, and call her"
"‘Mama Monster’, the den mother of their alternative world. As a"
"woman, Gaga’s big novelty is not her theatricality, talent or success"
"but that she has used these to open up a new space for pop fans."
"And this – Gaga’s gay-friendly, freak-friendly, campaigning facet –"
"might be the most exciting thing about her of all. For women, finding"
"a sympathetic, nonjudgemental arena is just as important as"
"getting the right to vote. We needed not just the right legislation, but"

"Abortion"
"I think I have polycystic ovaries. That’s what I’m getting the"
"ultrasound for. I’ve been to my GP three times with symptoms –"
"acne, exhaustion, weight gain, disrupted menstrual cycle – and this"
"is where they’ve referred me: the Ultrasound Unit at the Whittington"
"Hospital."
"Yes – with those symptoms, you think I’m pregnant, don’t"
"you? But I did a test six weeks ago, and got nothing, and this is"
"where my GP has sent me now. I’m eating two cans of tinned"
"pineapple for breakfast, and cry when I see a sad squirrel in an"
"advert. Of course I’m pregnant. But the test said not. And I’m still"
"breastfeeding. And I don’t want to be pregnant. So I’m not."
"I lie on the bed. The monitor is up on the wall, waiting to show"
"me what’s inside. I don’t really know what polycystic ovaries look"
"like, but I’m guessing I’ll see circles, like oxygen bubbles. Or maybe"
"something more visceral: clusters; bracts."
"As the nurse washes her hands, in preparation, the"
"ultrasound screen looks like the view from the deck of the"
"Millennium Falcon, when it’s parked up. Dark, black space, with"
"occasional speckles of light. Still."
"When they finally put the ultrasound to my belly, though, it’s"
"like the Light Jump: the whole solar system roars into life. Lines"
"and whorls and kidneys and guts. Moons with asteroids circling."
"And then, at the centre – low, deep, hidden – a pulsar. A signal. A"
"clock that’s ticking."
"That is a heartbeat."
"‘You’re pregnant!’ the nurse says, cheerfully. Nurses must be"
"told to always say this cheerfully. They always do – however pale the"
"client is, or however loudly the client has just said ‘Fuck’ and started"
"shaking."
"She is doing calculations, with an on-screen tape measure."
"‘I would say you’re around 11 weeks,’ she says, pushing the"
"ultrasound monitor into my belly."
"That really is it – there is nothing else that looks like a foetus."
"The curve of the spine, like an etiolated crescent moon. The"
"astronaut helmet skull. The black, unblinking eyes, like a prawn."
"‘Oh my God,’ I say, to the baby. ‘Oh, you outrageous thing.’"
"I am sure he is my gay son – the one I always wanted. His"
"entrance is so showy – so jazz-hands, so ‘Ta-da!’ So sudden. So"

"know, with calm certainty, that I don’t want another child now, in the"
"same way I know absolutely that I don’t want to go to India, or be"
"blonde, or fire a gun."
"This isn’t who I’m going to be, again: another three years of"
"being life support to someone who weeps for me, and rages"

"resting their head on my belly, and dreaming they’re back inside. My"

"germ! – until I realised it need never be a problem: on the trolley, on"

"take their hearts and swallow them, and give birth to them again, so"

"But I will only do one thing for this baby – as quickly as I can,"
"before it goes any further."
"I thank the nurse, wipe the jelly from my stomach and go"
"outside, to make a call."
"In 2007, Guardian columnist Zoe Williams wrote a wholly clearheaded and admirable piece, examining why women always felt"
"compelled to preface discussion about their abortions with an"
"obligatory, ‘Of course, it’s terribly traumatic. No woman enters into"
"this lightly.’"
"She went on to explain that this is because, however liberal a"
"society is, it assumes that, at its absolute core, abortion is wrong –"
"but that a forgiving state must make legal and medical provision for"
"it, lest desperate women ‘do a Vera Drake’ down a back alley, and"
"make things even worse."
"Abortions are never seen as a positive thing, as any other"
"operation to remedy a potentially life-ruining condition would."
"Women never speak publicly about their abortions with happy,"
"relieved gratitude. There are no ‘Good luck with your morning-after"
"pill!’ cards. People don’t make jokes about it despite the fact that all"
"the truest jokes are about vexed topics and cover every other"
"subject, including cancer, God and death."
"Additionally, there is the spectrum of ‘wrongness’ to consider."
"There are ‘good abortions’ and ‘bad abortions’ – like Chris Morris’s"
"sketch on Brass Eye, where he discusses ‘good AIDS’ and ‘bad"
"AIDS’. Haemophiliacs who caught the virus from blood transfusions"
"have ‘good AIDS’, and deserve sympathy. Homosexuals who picked"
"up the virus from casual sex, however, have ‘bad AIDS’, and are"
"accorded no solicitude at all."
"A raped teenage girl seeking an abortion – or a mother whose"
"life is endangered by the pregnancy – is having a ‘good’ abortion."
"She still won’t discuss it publicly, or expect her friends to be happy"
"for her, but these women get away with barely any stigmatisation."
"At the other end of the spectrum, of course, are the ‘worst’"
"kind of abortions: repeated abortions, late-term abortions, abortions"
"after IVF, and – worst of all – mothers who have abortions. Our view"
"of motherhood is still so idealised and misty – Mother, gentle giver"
"of life – that the thought of a mother subsequently setting limits on"
"her capacity to nurture, and refusing to give further life, seems"
""
"obscene."
"For mothers must pretend that they are loving and protective"
"of all life, however nascent or putative it might be. They should – we"
"still quietly believe, deep down inside – be prepared to give and give"
"and give, until they simply wear out. The greatest mother – the"
"perfect mother – would carry to term every child she conceived, no"
"matter how disruptive or ruinous, because her love would be great"
"enough for anything and everyone."
"Women who decide to continue with pregnancies that"
"endanger their lives – ‘Doctors told me another pregnancy would kill"
"me – but here’s baby William!’– are written about in magazine"
"features as admirable; the ultimate mothers. They are the truest"
"embodiment of oxytocin, the pregnancy hormone of love and"
"bonding that keeps the world full."
"Women should be, essentially, capable of endless, selfsacrificial love."
"I have problems with that assumption. For one thing, I believe"
"something very elemental and, in the theological sense, nonChristian. One of the big dilemmas over abortion is trying to work"
"out where ‘life’ begins with a foetus – concluding that if abortion"
"could occur before ‘life’ begins, that would be a ‘right’ kind of"
"abortion. But given that both science and philosophy continue to"
"struggle to define what the beginning of ‘life’ is, wouldn’t it be better"
"to come at the debate from a different angle entirely? For if a"
"pregnant woman has dominion over life, why should she not also"
"have dominion over not-life? This is a concept understood by other"
"cultures. The Hindu goddess Kali is both Mother of the Whole"
"Universe, and Devourer of All Things. She is life and death. In"
"Sumeria, Inanna is the goddess of sex and fertility, but also turns"
"into Ereshkigal, goddess of the underworld. On a very elemental"
"level, if women are, by biology, commanded to host, shelter, nurture"
"and protect life, why should they not be empowered to end life, too?"
"I’m not advocating stoving in the heads of children, or"
"encouraging late abortions – but then, no one is. What I am vexed"
"with is the idea that, by having an abortion, a woman is somehow"
"being unfemale and, indeed, unmotherly. That the absolute"
"essence of womanhood and maternity is to sustain life, at all costs,"
"whatever the situation."
"My belief in the ultimate sociological, emotional and practical"
"necessity for abortion became even stronger after I had my two"
"children. It is only after you have had a nine-month pregnancy,"
"laboured to get the child out, fed it, cared for it, sat with it until 3am,"
"risen with it at 6am, swooned with love for it and been reduced to"
"furious tears by it that you really understand just how important it is"
"for a child to be wanted. How motherhood is a game you must enter"
"with as much energy, willingness and happiness as possible."
"And the most important thing of all, of course, is to be wanted,"
"desired and cared for by a reasonably sane, stable mother. I can"
"honestly say that my abortion was one of the least difficult decisions"
"of my life. I’m not being flippant when I say it took me longer to"
"decide what worktops to have in the kitchen than whether I was"
"prepared to spend the rest of my life being responsible for a further"
"human being, because I knew that to do it again – to commit my life"
"to another person – might very possibly stretch my abilities, and"
"conception of who I am, and who I want to be, and what I want and"
"need to do – to breaking point. The idea that I might not – in an"
""
"earlier era, or a different country – have a choice in the matter,"
"seems both emotionally and physically barbaric."
"As Germaine Greer puts it in The Whole Woman, ‘to become"
"a mother without wanting it is to live like a slave, or domestic"
"animal.’"
"Of course, there was every chance that I might eventually be"
"thankful for the arrival of a third child. He might have arrived, and"
"forced me to discover new reserves of energy, dedication and love."
"She might have been the best thing that ever happened to me. But I"
"am, personally, not a gambler. I won’t spend £1 on the lottery, let"
"alone take a punt on a pregnancy. The stakes are far, far too high. I"
"can’t agree with a society that would force me to bet on how much I"
"could love under duress."
"I cannot understand anti-abortion arguments that centre on"
"the sanctity of life. As a species, we’ve fairly comprehensively"
"demonstrated that we don’t believe in the sanctity of life. The"
"shrugging acceptance of war, famine, epidemic, pain and lifelong,"
"grinding poverty show us that, whatever we tell ourselves, we’ve"
"made only the most feeble of efforts to really treat human life as"
"sacred."
"I don’t understand, then, why, in the midst of all this, pregnant"
"women – women trying to make rational decisions about their"
"futures and, usually, that of their families, too – should be subject to"
"more pressure about preserving life than, say, Vladimir Putin, the"
"World Bank, or the Catholic Church."
"However, what I do believe to be genuinely sacred – and,"
"indeed, more useful to the earth as a whole – is trying to ensure that"
"there are as few unbalanced, destructive people as possible. By"
"whatever rationale you use, ending a pregnancy 12 weeks into"
"gestation is incalculably more moral than bringing an unwanted"
"child into this world."
"It’s those unhappy, unwanted children, who then grew into"
"angry adults, who have caused the great majority of human-kind’s"
"miseries. They are the ones who make estates feel feral; streets"
"dangerous; relationships violent. If psychoanalysis has, somewhat"
"brutally, laid the responsibility for psychological disorders at"
"parents’ doors, the least we can do is to tip our hats to women"
"aware enough not to create those troubled people in the first place."
"But, of course, we don’t. In the last two years, three bills have"
"been tabled in the Commons seeking to curtail women’s access to"
"termination. The Times reported that ‘Unprecedented numbers’ of"

"POSTSCRIPT"
""
"London, October 2010"
"So do I know how to be a woman now? The pat, self-deprecating"
"thing would be to say, ‘No. No, I still don’t have a clue! I’m just still"
"the same schlumpy, well-meaning idiot I was at 13. I’m still just a"
"chimp in a frock with a laptop, setting fire to saucepans, falling"
"down staircases, saying the wrong thing and feeling like an"
"insecure child inside. I’m a buffoon! A div! A numnut!’"
"Because, of course, there are still ways in which I don’t know"
"how to be a woman yet. I’ve not had to deal with teenage children, or"
"family bereavement, or the menopause, or losing my job. I still can’t"
"iron, do maths, drive a car or – and I must be frank here – 100 per"
"cent reliably remember which is ‘left’ and which is ‘right’ in an"
"emergency. I am responsible, when navigating, for a lot of"
"screeching U-turns and swearing. There’s still a million things I"
"have left to learn. A billion. A trillion. In terms of how much better I"
"potentially could be, I’ve barely even been born yet. I’m still an egg."
"But then, on the other hand, I distrust this female habit of"
"reflexively flagging up your own shortcomings. Not the breezy, airy"
"witticism in the face of a compliment – ‘Lost weight? No. We’re just"
"in a larger room than usual, darling.’ ‘You think my children are well"
"mannered? I have wired them with small electrodes, and every time"
"they misbehave, I punch the “Bad Kid” button in my pocket.’ That’s"
"fine."
"No – I’m talking about the common attitudinal habit in women"
"that we’re kind of … failing if we’re not a bit neurotic. That we’re"
"somehow boorish, complacent and unfeminine if we’re content."
"The way women feel that they are not so much well-meaning"
"human beings doing the best that they can but, instead, an endless"
"list of problems (fat, hairy, unfashionable, spotty, smelly, tired,"
"unsexy, and with a dodgy pelvic floor, to boot) to be solved. And that,"
"with the application of a great deal of time and money – I mean, a"
"great deal of time and money. Have you seen how much laser hair"
"removal is? – we might, one day, 20 years into the future, finally be"
"able to put our feet up and say, ‘For nine minutes today, I almost"
"nailed it!’"
"Before, of course, starting up the whole grim, remorseless,"
"thankless schedule again, the next day, all over again."
"So if I was asked, ‘Do you know how to be a woman now?’,"
"my answer would be, ‘Kind of yes, really, to be honest.’"
"Because if all the stories in this book add up to one single"
"revelation, it is this: to just … not really give a shit about all that stuff."
"To not care about all those supposed ‘problems’ of being a woman."
"To refuse to see them as problems at all. Yes – when I had my"
"massive feminist awakening, the action it provoked in me was a …"
"big shrug."
"As it turned out, almost every notion I had on my 13th birthday"
"about my future turned out to be a total waste of my time. When I"
"thought of myself as an adult, all I could imagine was someone"
"thin, and smooth, and calm, to whom things … happened. Some"
"kind of souped-up princess, with a credit card. I didn’t have any"
"notion about self-development, or following my interests, or learning"
"big life lessons, or, most importantly, finding out what I was good at,"
"and trying to earn a living from it. I presumed that these were all"
"things that some grown-ups would come along and basically tell"
""
"me what to do at some point, and that I shouldn’t really worry about"
"them. I didn’t worry about what I was going to do."
"What I did worry about, and thought I should work hard at, was"
"what I should be, instead. I thought all my efforts should be"
"concentrated on being fabulous, rather than doing fabulous things. I"
"thought my big tasks were discovering my ‘Love Style’ via"
"questionnaires in Cosmopolitan, assembling a capsule wardrobe,"
"learning how to go from day to night with the application of heels"
"and lipstick, finding a signature perfume, planning when to have a"
"baby, and learning how to be mesmerically sexually proficient – but"
"without getting a reputation as a total slag. Whilst, at the same time,"
"somehow losing a whole load of character traits that would blow my"
"whole ‘pretending to be a proper woman’ cover – talking too fast,"
"falling over, arguing, emitting smells, getting angry, being quite"
"excited about the idea of a revolution, and wanting to be a guest star"
"o n The Muppet Show, in a plot where Gonzo fell in love with me."
"Even though they’d stopped making The Muppet Show seven years"
"previously."
"I presumed that once I’d cracked being thin, beautiful, stylishly"
"dressed, poised and gracious, everything else would fall into place."
"That my real life’s work was not a career – but myself. That if I"
"worked on being pleasing, the world would adore, and then reward"
"me."
"Of course, this supposition that women are supposed to just"
"‘be’, while men go out and ‘do’, have been argued as inimically sextied traits. Men go out and do things – wage wars, discover new"
"countries, conquer space, tour Use Your Illusion I and II – whilst the"
"women inspire them to greater things, then discuss afterwards, at"
"length, what’s happened: like Ena Sharples and Minnie Caldwell"
"over a bottle of milk stout."
"But I don’t know if I believe ‘being’ is an innately female thing"
"to do – that that’s just how we’re wired. Going back to my previous"
"argument – about so many suppositions about ‘femaleness’"
"actually coming down to us having been ‘losers’ for so long – I"
"would suggest that when you’ve spent millennia not being allowed"
"to do anything, you do tend to become more focused on being selfcritical, analytical and reflective because there’s nothing else you"
"can do, really, other than a) look hot and b) turn inward."
"Would Jane Austen’s characters have spent pages and"
"pages discussing all the relationships in their social circle if they’d"
"been a bit more in control of their own destinies? Would women fret"
"themselves half to death over how they look, and who fancies them,"
"if this wasn’t the main thing they were still judged on? Would we"
"give so much of a shit about our thighs if we, as a sex, owned the"
"majority of the world’s wealth, instead of the men?"
"When I think of everything about womanhood that hamstrung"
"me with fear when I was 13, it all came down, really, to princesses. I"
"didn’t think I had to work hard to be a woman – which is scary, but,"
"obviously, eventually achievable. I thought I had to somehow,"
"magically, through super-human psychic effort, transform into a"
"princess, instead. That’s how I’d get fallen in love with. That’s how"
"I’d get along. That’s how the world would welcome me. The books;"
"the Disney films; the most famous woman in the world being, when"
"I was a child, Princess Diana: whilst there were other role models"
"around, the sheer onslaught of princessalia every girl is subject to"
"wedges its way into the heart, in a quietly pernicious way."
""
"In the last decade, the post-feminist reaction to princesses"
"has been the creation of ‘alternative’ princesses: the spunky chicks"
"in Shrek and the newer Disney films, who wear trousers, do kungfu, and save the prince. Possibly as a reaction to the life, and then"
"death, of Diana, princesses have had to be reconfigured to"
"acknowledge that we all now know that being a real princess isn’t"
"all about wafting around in a castle, being beautiful and noble. It’s"
"about eating disorders, loneliness, Wham! mix-tapes, shagging"
"around, waging a pitched battle with the royal family, and, eventually,"
"the incredible fascination that you hold over others conspiring to kill"
"you."
"It’s interesting to note that, since the death of Diana, women"
"have generally lost interest in the idea of actually being a real"
"princess. Princesses have forfeited a great deal of their currency."
"When Prince Charles was of marriageable age, he was the subject"
"of worldwide perving from the ladyfolk: treated as a cross between"
"James Bond and Prince Charming. And when Diana married him,"
"women across the world sighed over the dress, the ring, the"
"diamonds, and the dreamlike life she was marrying into."
"When Prince William announced his marriage to Kate"
"Middleton, on the other hand, womenfolk were united in their"
"sentiments: ‘Poor cow. Jesus Christ, does she know what she’s let"
"herself in for? A lifetime of scrutiny, bitching, pap-shots of her"
"thighs, and speculation on her state of mind. Rather you than me,"
"darling.’"
"No – the dream now for women still set on ‘being’, rather than"
"‘doing’, is to become a WAG, instead. Marry a footballer, and you get"
"a princess’s wealth, glamour and privilege – plus the same, implicit"
"acceptance that your powerful husband is going to cheat on you,"
"and that you just have to accept that – but without the expectation"
"that you also have to be demure, upstanding and good at a"
"banquet. The WAG is the 21st-century princess."
"But whether it’s a WAG in Dolce & Gabbana at Mahiki, or Ariel"
"in her fish-tail under the sea, the tropes of ‘princess women’ are"
"still the same. The residual hold they have over female ability to"
"imagine our own future is sneakily harmful."
"What is it about the princess that is so wrong? Well, I know"
"that – from personal experience – the thing that has given me the"
"most relief and freedom in my adult years has been, finally, once"
"and for all giving up on the idea that I might secretly be, or will one"
"day become, a princess. Accepting you’re just some perfectly"
"ordinary woman who is going to have to crack on, work hard and be"
"polite in order to get anything done is – once you’ve got over the"
"crippling disappointment of your thundering ordinariness –"
"incredibly liberating."
"Let me list my aspects of non-princessiness –"
"acknowledgement of each gained with terrible initial sadness and"
"loss."
"1) I can’t sing. Admitting that to myself was a massive"
"sorrow – all princesses sing. All women are supposed"
"to be able to sing. They can calm the birds in the trees"
"as soon as they start trilling. By way of contrast, I sound"
"like the noise gigantic 16-wheeler trucks make, just"
"before they smash into a police roadblock. HONK"
"HONK. SCREEEECH. ‘Oh my God – no one will come"
""
"out of that alive.’"
"2) I don’t taste sweet – like cake, or honey. I can’t tell you"
"the amount of filthy books I’ve read that led me to"
"believe that, when a man went down on you, he was"
"basically lapping away on a Sherbet Dip Dab. The first"
"time someone commented – positively, mind – that I"
"tasted like ‘a lovely pie’, I cried hysterically for two hours"
"afterwards. What kind of stompy, sweaty, beefy item was"
"I? It was supposed to be like tiramisu down there …"
"some kind of sweet, milky paradise; junket pudding. Not"
"some hearty peasant main course. A hog roast. But we"
"are, of course, sweaty, fleshy lady-animals – all fur and"
"umami. Of course we don’t taste like a Bird’s Strawberry"
"Trifle – like a princess would."
"3) I’m not going to be worshipped by some powerful,"
"loaded, sword-wielding man, who will change my life if I"
"marry him. Because that is Aragorn, son of Arathorn,"
"and he doesn’t exist. I don’t want some alpha-y"
"patriarchal brute – some confident man of action, who"
"will treat me like ‘his woman’. When P. J. O’Rourke"
"said, ‘No woman ever dreamed of being thrown on a"
"bed and ravished by someone dressed as a liberal,’ I"
"wished to cry, ‘Speak for yourself, dear! You are scarcely"
"qualified to judge. When were you last in All Bar One in"
"your Spanx, eyeing up the ass?’ In the modern world,"
"this old-fashioned notion of what makes men desirable"
"to women is useless and outdated: as evidenced by the"
"fact that it’s usually only people over the age of 40 who"
"ever go on about it. For most people under that age, they"
"see that this is a time where what really makes a man"
"‘alpha’ is avoiding pugilism (the legal system is a drag,"
"plus expensive), being amusing (we’re sitting on top of"
"50 years’ worth of amazing sitcoms. If you haven’t"
"picked up a couple of techniques for cracking a joke by"
"now, you look a trifle slow-witted), and, as a bonus,"
"knowing how to reinstall Adobe AIR when Twitter goes"
"down on your laptop. Speaking for all my lady friends,"
"we all want some geeky, nerdy, polite and ridiculous"
"mate who we can sit at home with, slagging off all the"
"tossers, and waiting for our baked potatoes to be ready."
"Who, obviously, is additionally so hot for us he regularly"
"crawls across the front room on his hands and knees,"
"croaking, ‘I must have sex with you now, or go literally"
"insane.’ Compared to that, Prince Charming looks like a"
"total donk."
"4) Princesses never run in gangs. They never have any"
"mates. There’s no palling around. Princesses never"
"spend the day wandering round the Natural History"
"Museum with their sisters, arguing about their favourite"
"mineral or stone (mine is the piece of peridot that"
"landed here in a meteor. Weena’s is feldspar: ‘It’s"
"sensual’). Princesses never sit outside a pub with a"
"couple of princes on a crisp autumn afternoon, putting"
"their favourite Beatles vocal performances into order of"
"preference. Princesses never go away with a couple of"
"other families on holiday, get a bit wankered, and end"
""
"up doing ‘The Nudey Run’ around a tree on the lawn, as"
"their children watch – disapprovingly – from an upstairs"
"window. Princesses don’t enliven a dull day in the office"
"by playing the game ‘I Am Burt Reynolds’. (A person is"
"chosen to be ‘it’. They must think of a celebrity. All the"
"other players must take it in turns to ask as many"
"questions as possible in order to guess the identity of"
"the celebrity, until – finally – someone asks, ‘Is it Burt"
"Reynolds?’ It is always Burt Reynolds. This game can"
"be played for hours.)"
"Anyway, by 16, I had a new idea. I didn’t want to be a princess."
"Princes were dull. I was all about the artists, instead. They were the"
"guys to be hanging with. I wanted to be a muse. I wanted to be a"
"muse quite badly. To be so incredible that some band wrote a song"
"about me, or some writer based a character on me, or a painter"
"produced canvas after canvas of me, in every mood, that hung in"
"galleries across the world. Or even a handbag. Jane Birkin inspired"
"a handbag. By way of contrast I would happily have settled for my"
"name on a plastic Superdrug bag."
"It’s not like I was the first ambitious girl to think this was how"
"to make my way in the world. In an interview in Please Kill Me. Patti"
"Smith – by all accounts a feminist goddess – recounted how, when"
"she was growing up in New Jersey, ‘the coolest thing in the world"
"was to become the mistress of a great artist. The first thing I did on"
"leaving home was to [move to New York and] become [legendary"
"photographer] Robert Mapplethorpe’s lover.’"
"Of course, in the end, when Mapplethorpe turned out to be"
"very gay, Smith was left with no other option than to go off and write"
"Horses, and grow the world’s most influential lady moustache,"
"instead. Her hand was forced into productivity."
"Inspired by Smith, when I started attending after-show parties,"
"drunk, I would stand around – trying to look so potent with mystery"
"that someone would be compelled to write a song about how cool I"
"was. Like a lady Fonz, but sexy. And when that plan abjectly failed,"
"and there were no songs about me, and I got a little drunker, I just"
"took a more direct root: tipsily berating friends in bands to"
"immortalise me in a song."
"‘It doesn’t have to be a big single,’ I would say, reasonably,"
"fag in my mouth the wrong way round. ‘I’m not that demanding. It"
"could be the first track on the album, instead. Or the final, anthemic"
"one, I suppose. The one that builds to an affirmative chorus about"
"how nothing’s going to be the same, now that you know me. Come"
"on – how long would it take – five minutes? Write a song about me."
"WRITE A SONG ABOUT ME. BE INSPIRED BY ME, YOU FUCK!’"
"It wasn’t purely out of egotism. ‘It would be good for"
"womankind as a whole if you wrote a song about someone like me,’"
"I would explain, nobly, as they quietly ordered a cab on their mobile."
"‘All the songs about girls are about some boring model that Eric"
"Clapton knew, or some groupie with an “inner sadness”. Don’t you"
"think women would be happier if Layla had a whole chorus about"
"Eric Clapton watching Patti Boyd trying to climb over a park fence,"
"pissed, in order to retrieve a shoe she threw in there, for a bet?"
"You’d be breaking new ground, man – muse-wise, it would be as"
"revolutionary as the sonic introduction of the electric guitar! WRITE A"
""
"SONG ABOUT A GOBBY BIRD! WRITE A SONG ABOUT"
"MEEEEEEEE, YOU FUCK!’"
"As the years went on – and my friends kept persistently not"
"writing novels, or West End musicals, about me – I gradually"
"realised that I’m just not the muse type. Girls like me don’t inspire"
"people."
"I’m just not muse material, I finally thought to myself, sadly, on"
"my 18th birthday – looking at a world wholly non-inspired by me. ‘I’m"
"not a princess. I’m not a muse. If I’m going to change the world, it’s"
"not going to be by endorsing a landmine charity in a tiara, or"
"inspiring the next Revolver. Just “being” me isn’t enough. I’m going"
"to have to do something, instead.’"
"And in the 21st century, being a woman who wants to do something"
"is not hard. At any other point in time, Western women agitating for"
"change would be at risk of imprisonment, social ostracisation, rape"
"and death. Now, however, women in the Western world can bring"
"about pretty much whatever change we want by writing a series of"
"slightly arsey letters, whilst listening to Radio 4 and drinking a cup"
"of tea."
"Whatever it is we want the future to be like, no one’s going to"
"have to die for it. Whilst we may still essentially be crying ‘Up the"
"purple, white and green!’, we can now put together an outfit in"
"whichever colours we choose, should purple, white and green look"
"‘clashy’. We do not have to throw ourselves under that horse."
"Simply being honest about who we really are is half the battle."
"If what you read in magazines and papers makes you feel uneasy"
"or shitty – don’t buy them! If you’re vexed by corporate entertaining"
"taking place in titty-bars – shame your colleagues! If you feel"
"oppressed by the idea of an expensive wedding – ignore your"
"mother-in-law, and run away to a registry office! And if you think a"
"£600 handbag is obscene, instead of bravely saying, ‘I’ll just have to"
"max my credit card,’ quietly say, ‘Actually, I can’t afford it.’"
"There’s so much stuff – in every respect – that we can’t afford"
"and yet we sighingly resign ourselves to, in order to join in, and feel"
"‘normal’. But, of course, if everyone is, somehow, too anxious to say"
"what their real situation is, then there is a new, communal, median"
"experience which is being kept secret by everyone being too"
"embarrassed to say, ‘Don’t think I’m a freak, but …’"
"Anyway, it’s not like this is all just about, and for, the ladies. If"
"women’s liberation truly comes to pass – as the slow, unstoppable"
"gravity of social and economic change suggests it must – then it’s"
"going to work out pretty peachy for the men, too. If I were the"
"patriarchy I would, frankly, be thrilled at the idea of women finally"
"getting an equal crack of the whip. Let’s face it – the patriarchy must"
"b e knackered by now. It’s been 100,000 years without even so"
"much as a tea break: men have been flat out ruling the world. They"
"have been balls to the wall."
"Faced, then, with the option of some manner of flexitime –"
"women ruling the world half the time – the patriarchy could finally"
"take its foot off the gas a bit; go on that orienteering holiday it’s been"
"talking about for years; really sort the shed out, once and for all. The"
"patriarchy could get stuck into some hardcore paint-balling"
""
"weekends."
"Because it’s not as if strident feminists want to take over from"
"men. We’re not arguing for the whole world. Just our share. The"
"men don’t really have to change a thing. As far as I’m concerned,"
"men can just carry on doing pretty much whatever they like. They"
"don’t really need to stop at all. Loads of stuff they’re doing – iPads,"
"and the Arctic Monkeys, that new nuclear arms deal between"
"America and Russia – is cool. And they’re funny, and I am friends"
"with lots of them, and they’re good for having sex with, and they look"
"great in reproduction World War 2 uniforms, or reversing into tight"
"parking spaces."
"I don’t want men to go away. I don’t want men to stop what"
"they’re doing."
"What I want, instead, are some radical market forces. I want"
"CHOICE. I want VARIETY. I want MORE. I want WOMEN. I want"
"women to have more of the world, not just because it would be"
"fairer, but because it would be better. More exciting. Reordered."
"Reinvented. We should have the lady-balls to say, ‘Yeah – I like the"
"look of this world. And I’ve been here for a good while, watching."
"Now – here’s how I’d tweak it. Because we’re all in this together."
"We’re all just, you know. The Guys.’"
"So, in the end, I suppose the title of the book is a bit of a misnomer."
"All through those stumbling, mortifying, amazing years, I thought"
"that what I wanted to be was a woman. To be some incredible"
"amalgam of Germaine Greer, Elizabeth Taylor, E. Nesbit, Courtney"
"Love, Jilly Cooper and Lady Gaga. Finding some way of mastering"
"all the arcane arts of being female, until I was some witchery"
"paragon of all the things that confused and defeated me at the"
"outset, in my bed, in Wolverhampton, at the age of 13. A princess. A"
"goddess. A muse."
"But as the years went on, I realised that what I really want to"
"be, all told, is a human. Just a productive, honest, courteously"
"treated human. One of ‘The Guys’. But with really amazing hair."

"very good at re-inspiring my ardour for the project – mainly by"
"reminding me that Carl Jung’s favourite party-trick was to whip"

"Men Explain Things to Me"
"I still don't know why Sallie and I bothered to go to that party in the forest"
"slope above Aspen. The people were all older than us and dull in a"
"distinguished way, old enough that we, at forty-ish, passed as the occasion's"
"young ladies. The house was great -- if you like Ralph Lauren-style chalets -- a"
"rugged luxury cabin at 9,000 feet complete with elk antlers, lots of kilims, and"
"a wood-burning stove. We were preparing to leave, when our host said, ""No,"
"stay a little longer so I can talk to you."" He was an imposing man who'd made"
"a lot of money."
"He kept us waiting while the other guests drifted out into the summer night,"
"and then sat us down at his authentically grainy wood table and said to me,"
"""So? I hear you've written a couple of books."""
"I replied, ""Several, actually."""
"He said, in the way you encourage your friend's seven-year-old to describe"
"flute practice, ""And what are they about?"""
"They were actually about quite a few different things, the six or seven out by"
"then, but I began to speak only of the most recent on that summer day in"
"2003, River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild"
"West, my book on the annihilation of time and space and the industrialization"
"of everyday life."
"He cut me off soon after I mentioned Muybridge. ""And have you heard about"
"the very important Muybridge book that came out this year?"""
"So caught up was I in my assigned role as ingénue that I was perfectly willing"
"to entertain the possibility that another book on the same subject had come"
"out simultaneously and I'd somehow missed it. He was already telling me"
"about the very important book -- with that smug look I know so well in a man"
"holding forth, eyes fixed on the fuzzy far horizon of his own authority."
"Here, let me just say that my life is well-sprinkled with lovely men, with a long"
"succession of editors who have, since I was young, listened and encouraged"
"and published me, with my infinitely generous younger brother, with splendid"
"friends of whom it could be said -- like the Clerk in The Canterbury Tales I"
"still remember from Mr. Pelen's class on Chaucer -- ""gladly would he learn"
"and gladly teach."" Still, there are these other men, too. So, Mr. Very"
"Important was going on smugly about this book I should have known when"
""
"Sallie interrupted him to say, ""That's her book."" Or tried to interrupt him"
"anyway."
"But he just continued on his way. She had to say, ""That's her book"" three or"
"four times before he finally took it in. And then, as if in a nineteenth-century"
"novel, he went ashen. That I was indeed the author of the very important book"
"it turned out he hadn't read, just read about in the New York Times Book"
"Review a few months earlier, so confused the neat categories into which his"
"world was sorted that he was stunned speechless -- for a moment, before he"
"began holding forth again. Being women, we were politely out of earshot"
"before we started laughing, and we've never really stopped."
"I like incidents of that sort, when forces that are usually so sneaky and hard to"
"point out slither out of the grass and are as obvious as, say, an anaconda that's"
"eaten a cow or an elephant turd on the carpet."
"When River of Shadows came out, some pedant wrote a snarky letter to the"
"New York Times explaining that, though Muybridge had made improvements"
"in camera technology, he had not made any breakthroughs in photographic"
"chemistry. The guy had no idea what he was talking about. Both Philip"
"Prodger, in his wonderful book on Muybridge, and I had actually researched"
"the subject and made it clear that Muybridge had done something obscure but"
"powerful to the wet-plate technology of the time to speed it up amazingly, but"
"letters to the editor don't get fact-checked. And perhaps because the book was"
"about the virile subjects of cinema and technology, the Men Who Knew came"
"out of the woodwork."
"A British academic wrote in to the London Review of Books with all kinds of"
"nitpicking corrections and complaints, all of them from outer space. He"
"carped, for example, that to aggrandize Muybridge's standing I left out"
"technological predecessors like Henry R. Heyl. He'd apparently not read the"
"book all the way to page 202 or checked the index, since Heyl was there"
"(though his contribution was just not very significant). Surely one of these"
"men has died of embarrassment, but not nearly publicly enough."
""
"The Slippery Slope of Silencings"
"Yes, guys like this pick on other men's books too, and people of both genders"
"pop up at events to hold forth on irrelevant things and conspiracy theories,"
"but the out-and-out confrontational confidence of the totally ignorant is, in"
"my experience, gendered. Men explain things to me, and other women,"
"whether or not they know what they're talking about. Some men."
"Every woman knows what I'm talking about. It's the presumption that makes"
"it hard, at times, for any woman in any field; that keeps women from speaking"
""
"up and from being heard when they dare; that crushes young women into"
"silence by indicating, the way harassment on the street does, that this is not"
"their world. It trains us in self-doubt and self-limitation just as it exercises"
"men's unsupported overconfidence."
"(...)"
"Arrogance might have had something to do with the war, but this syndrome is"
"a war that nearly every woman faces every day, a war within herself too, a"
"belief in her superfluity, an invitation to silence, one from which a fairly nice"
"career as a writer (with a lot of research and facts correctly deployed) has not"
"entirely freed me. After all, there was a moment there when I was willing to"
"let Mr. Important and his overweening confidence bowl over my more shaky"
"certainty."
"Don't forget that I've had a lot more confirmation of my right to think and"
"speak than most women, and I've learned that a certain amount of self-doubt"
"is a good tool for correcting, understanding, listening, and progressing -though too much is paralyzing and total self-confidence produces arrogant"
"idiots, like the ones who have governed us since 2001. There's a happy"
"medium between these poles to which the genders have been pushed, a warm"
"equatorial belt of give and take where we should all meet."
"More extreme versions of our situation exist in, for example, those Middle"
"Eastern countries where women's testimony has no legal standing; so that a"
"woman can't testify that she was raped without a male witness to counter the"
"male rapist. Which there rarely is."
"Credibility is a basic survival tool. When I was very young and just beginning"
"to get what feminism was about and why it was necessary, I had a boyfriend"
"whose uncle was a nuclear physicist. One Christmas, he was telling -- as"
"though it were a light and amusing subject -- how a neighbor's wife in his"
"suburban bomb-making community had come running out of her house"
"naked in the middle of the night screaming that her husband was trying to kill"
"her. How, I asked, did you know that he wasn't trying to kill her? He"
"explained, patiently, that they were respectable middle-class people."
"Therefore, her-husband-trying-to-kill-her was simply not a credible"
"explanation for her fleeing the house yelling that her husband was trying to"
"kill her. That she was crazy, on the other hand..."
"Even getting a restraining order -- a fairly new legal tool -- requires acquiring"
"the credibility to convince the courts that some guy is a menace and then"
"getting the cops to enforce it. Restraining orders often don't work anyway."
"Violence is one way to silence people, to deny their voice and their credibility,"
"to assert your right to control over their right to exist. About three women a"
""
"day are murdered by spouses or ex-spouses in this country. It's one of the"
"main causes of death in pregnant women in the U.S. At the heart of the"
"struggle of feminism to give rape, date rape, marital rape, domestic violence,"
"and workplace sexual harassment legal standing as crimes has been the"
"necessity of making women credible and audible."
"I tend to believe that women acquired the status of human beings when these"
"kinds of acts started to be taken seriously, when the big things that stop us"
"and kill us were addressed legally from the mid-1970s on; well after, that is,"
"my birth. And for anyone about to argue that workplace sexual intimidation"
"isn't a life or death issue, remember that Marine Lance Corporal Maria"
"Lauterbach, age 20, was apparently killed by her higher-ranking colleague last"
"winter while she was waiting to testify that he raped her. The burned remains"
"of her pregnant body were found in the fire pit in his backyard in December."
"Being told that, categorically, he knows what he's talking about and she"
"doesn't, however minor a part of any given conversation, perpetuates the"
"ugliness of this world and holds back its light. After my book Wanderlust"
"came out in 2000, I found myself better able to resist being bullied out of my"
"own perceptions and interpretations. On two occasions around that time, I"
"objected to the behavior of a man, only to be told that the incidents hadn't"
"happened at all as I said, that I was subjective, delusional, overwrought,"
"dishonest -- in a nutshell, female."
"Most of my life, I would have doubted myself and backed down. Having"
"public standing as a writer of history helped me stand my ground, but few"
"women get that boost, and billions of women must be out there on this sixbillion-person planet being told that they are not reliable witnesses to their"
"own lives, that the truth is not their property, now or ever. This goes way"
"beyond Men Explaining Things, but it's part of the same archipelago of"
"arrogance."
"Men explain things to me, still. And no man has ever apologized for"
"explaining, wrongly, things that I know and they don't. Not yet, but according"
"to the actuarial tables, I may have another forty-something years to live, more"
"or less, so it could happen. Though I'm not holding my breath."
""
"Women Fighting on Two Fronts"
"A few years after the idiot in Aspen, I was in Berlin giving a talk when the"
"Marxist writer Tariq Ali invited me out to a dinner that included a male writer"
"and translator and three women a little younger than me who would remain"
"deferential and mostly silent throughout the dinner. Tariq was great. Perhaps"
"the translator was peeved that I insisted on playing a modest role in the"
"conversation, but when I said something about how Women Strike for Peace,"
""
"the extraordinary, little-known antinuclear and antiwar group founded in"
"1961, helped bring down the communist-hunting House Committee on UnAmerican Activities, HUAC, Mr. Very Important II sneered at me. HUAC, he"
"insisted, didn't exist by the early 1960s and, anyway, no women's group"
"played such a role in HUAC's downfall. His scorn was so withering, his"
"confidence so aggressive, that arguing with him seemed a scary exercise in"
"futility and an invitation to more insult."
"I think I was at nine books at that point, including one that drew from"
"primary documents and interviews about Women Strike for Peace. But"
"explaining men still assume I am, in some sort of obscene impregnation"
"metaphor, an empty vessel to be filled with their wisdom and knowledge. A"
"Freudian would claim to know what they have and I lack, but intelligence is"
"not situated in the crotch -- even if you can write one of Virginia Woolf's long"
"mellifluous musical sentences about the subtle subjugation of women in the"
"snow with your willie. Back in my hotel room, I Googled a bit and found that"
"Eric Bentley in his definitive history of the House Committee on Un-American"
"Activities credits Women Strike for Peace with ""striking the crucial blow in"
"the fall of HUAC's Bastille."" In the early 1960s."
"So I opened an essay for the Nation with this interchange, in part as a shoutout to one of the more unpleasant men who have explained things to me:"
"Dude, if you're reading this, you're a carbuncle on the face of humanity and an"
"obstacle to civilization. Feel the shame."
"The battle with Men Who Explain Things has trampled down many women -of my generation, of the up-and-coming generation we need so badly, here"
"and in Pakistan and Bolivia and Java, not to speak of the countless women"
"who came before me and were not allowed into the laboratory, or the library,"
"or the conversation, or the revolution, or even the category called human."
"After all, Women Strike for Peace was founded by women who were tired of"
"making the coffee and doing the typing and not having any voice or decisionmaking role in the antinuclear movement of the 1950s. Most women fight"
"wars on two fronts, one for whatever the putative topic is and one simply for"
"the right to speak, to have ideas, to be acknowledged to be in possession of"
"facts and truths, to have value, to be a human being. Things have certainly"
"gotten better, but this war won't end in my lifetime. I'm still fighting it, for"
"myself certainly, but also for all those younger women who have something to"
"say, in the hope that they will get to say it."
